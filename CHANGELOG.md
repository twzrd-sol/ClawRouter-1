## v0.12.276 — September 6, 2026

### Fixed — Gemini 3.8 Flash was routable but uncatalogued, which is a cost-cap hole

`google/gemini-3.8-flash` has been live in the BlockRun catalog (chat, reasoning, coding, vision; $0.75/$3.75, 1M context) while `src/models.ts` carried no entry for it. Anything that pins it by id reached the gateway and got an answer, so it looked healthy — but `estimateAmount()` returns `undefined` for an id this catalog does not carry, and three guards read that as "free":

- the pre-request balance check never runs, so an underfunded wallet gets an x402 failure mid-request instead of a fallback to a free model
- strict `maxCostPerRun` projects `$0` for the request, so the cap cannot trip on it
- session spend never accumulates, so the cap reads `$0.00` no matter how many of these calls have gone out

This is the failure mode already documented on `zai/glm-5.3-flash`: an uncatalogued routing target is a cost-cap hole, not a logging gap. Surfaced by [ClawRouter-Hermes #40](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter-Hermes/pull/40), which pinned the model from the Hermes picker — the first curated picker entry this catalog did not carry.

Added to `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`, to `src/top-models.json` above `gemini-3.6-flash` (Google runs descending after the pro) and to the README pricing table. No alias shorthands: `clawrouter.aliases` is published in the brand artifact and asserted here, so `gemini-3.8` / `gemini-3.8-flash` shorthands wait on that number moving upstream.

## v0.12.275 — September 5, 2026

### Added — a collision gate pinned to an OpenClaw version that actually collides

The existing container harness pins `openclaw@2026.5.4` — the release before OpenClaw began bundling its own `clawrouter` plugin — so the id collision from #305 cannot occur there, and every other harness floats on `@latest`, which cannot hold a version-specific regression still. The unit tests mock `homedir` and never see the installer, while both production failures were installer-shaped.

`npm run test:e2e:openclaw-collision` drives the real installer against a pinned 2026.8.2. Opt-in, not wired into CI; it sandboxes `HOME` and strips `BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY` and the `OPENCLAW_*` overrides from the child environment, so it cannot touch a real wallet or config. From [#320](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/320) by [@twzrd-sol](https://github.com/twzrd-sol).

### Fixed — the wallet rails never said which gateway they were using

Three rails, three gateways: an API key goes to `api.blockrun.ai`, a Solana wallet to `sol.blockrun.ai`, a Base wallet to `blockrun.ai`. Only two of them said so. `/health` reported `gateway` in API-key mode only, and startup logged the chain for Solana but printed nothing at all for Base — so the default rail was the one that never announced itself.

Which gateway a request went to is the single most useful fact when a paid call fails, and its absence cost a round trip on every report that needed it. All three now name it, in both `/health` and the startup log.

## v0.12.274 — September 5, 2026

### Fixed — `clawrouter policy` spend limits now hold on the API-key rail

`SpendControl` was reached only through the x402 pre-sign hook, so on the API-key rail none of it ran. Someone who set `daily=5` on a wallet and then ran `clawrouter login` kept a config file that read like a $5/day cap and got their account balance instead. The startup warning was the only thing standing between those two readings.

The amount windows — `perRequest`, `hourly`, `daily`, `session` — are denominated in USD and say nothing about how money moves, so they mean the same thing on both rails and are now enforced on both, from the same `spending.json`. The key rail has no signature to refuse, so they moved to its only equivalent choke point: the fetch every paid call goes through.

Two things there work out better than on the wallet rail. What gets recorded is what the gateway actually **charged** (`x-blockrun-cost-usd`) when it says so, not a local estimate; and a request the gateway rejected costs the window nothing, because account credit is not debited for it. An async image, audio or video job is billed once at submit — its status polls are neither checked nor recorded, so a long poll loop cannot drain a daily window on its own.

The counterparty lists (`blockedPayees`, `allowedPayees`, `allowedNetworks`, `allowedAssets`) stay wallet-only, on purpose: they presuppose a payee, a network and an on-chain asset, and account credit has one counterparty and no asset. They are vacuous on that rail rather than missing. The startup warning narrowed to say exactly that, and now also states plainly that the amount limits **do** apply.

Reported by [@twzrd-sol](https://github.com/twzrd-sol) in [#329](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/329).

### Fixed — the plugin-id migration missed the config an ordinary pre-rename install actually has

Since [#313](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/313) the gateway-start migration asked for BlockRun-owned fields (`walletKey`, `routing`) under `plugins.entries.clawrouter` before touching that entry. OpenClaw's installer commits `{ "enabled": true }` and nothing else for an `enabledByDefault` plugin, and the wallet lives at `~/.openclaw/blockrun/wallet.key` rather than in `openclaw.json` — so the common case carries neither field and was never migrated on the `npm update -g` + restart path.

Verified against a real `openclaw@2026.8.2`, that left two shapes on disk. A legacy `{ enabled: true }` ended up explicitly enabling **OpenClaw's own bundled router**, a product the user never configured. Worse, a legacy `{ enabled: false }` — a pre-rename opt-out — was **inverted**: the bundled router went off, BlockRun came on by the installer default, and the proxy started on a machine where the user had turned it off.

The gate now also accepts what `clawrouter setup` already treats as proof: a legacy package directory whose `package.json` names `@blockrun/clawrouter`. That is unambiguous where config fields are not, and it does not widen the heuristic #313 narrowed — an entry OpenClaw wrote for its own router has no such directory behind it. Without either kind of evidence the entry is still left alone.

Reported by [@twzrd-sol](https://github.com/twzrd-sol) in [#319](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/319).

### Fixed — the EADDRINUSE reuse path checked the payment chain and nothing else

v0.12.273 bound proxy reuse to the credential, but only on the pre-listen probe. `startProxy` reaches a running proxy a second way: the EADDRINUSE branch taken when another process wins the bind in between. That branch compared the payment chain alone, so an API-key caller landing on a Base wallet proxy reused it and got back a handle reporting `authMode: "api-key"` and the key's masked label — while every request was paid in USDC from the wallet. It also tested the reported wallet for truthiness, and an API-key proxy publishes an empty one, so that case fell through to a non-`Error` throw.

Both paths now run the same validator: auth mode, API key and payment chain, one rule instead of two.

Found by [@KillerQueen-Z](https://github.com/KillerQueen-Z) in [#343](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/343), the remaining finding on that PR after v0.12.273 landed the rest.

### Fixed — two different wallets no longer swap silently

`resolveExistingWalletKey` prefers BlockRun Core over ClawRouter's legacy `wallet.key`, and the legacy→Core migration copies only when Core is absent — so in the common case both hold the same key and the precedence is invisible. It becomes visible when Core was written independently by another BlockRun product while ClawRouter already had its own funded wallet: payment moved on upgrade, requests started failing on an empty balance, and the funded wallet sat idle with nothing having said so.

Core still wins. Preferring legacy would make Desktop display and fund one address while the proxy spent from another, and refusing outright would turn a working install into a hard failure for anyone legitimately holding two wallets. What was wrong was the silence: startup now names both addresses and the one line that keeps paying from the old one. `~/.blockrun/.chain` overriding this install's own saved chain — a different signer and a different gateway — is reported the same way.

Reported in [#315](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/315).

## v0.12.273 — September 5, 2026

### Fixed — a second API key could attach to a proxy billing the first account

Proxy reuse compared wallet-vs-key but never **which** key, while its own comment claimed to "never reuse across credentials". So `clawrouter login` with a second key, against a port already serving the first, attached silently: the new process printed the new key and reported `listening`, and every request went on being charged to the previous account.

Reproduced on the shipped v0.12.272 — a proxy started with key A kept answering `/health` as key A while a second process configured for key B reported success on the same port. Cross-account billing behind a success message.

Reuse is now bound to the credential: the masked label `/health` publishes must match, and an older proxy that reports no label is refused rather than assumed to match, because an unverifiable credential on a money path is not a match. Same-key reuse — one machine, one key, a second client attaching — is unaffected.

## v0.12.272 — September 5, 2026

### Added — the API key is pinned to one origin, and never falls back to a wallet by accident

Rebase of [#338](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/338) by [@KillerQueen-Z](https://github.com/KillerQueen-Z), whose security work this is.

The bearer token is now pinned to a single origin and `redirect: "error"` refuses to follow a redirect — a redirect being the quiet way a credential leaves the host it was minted for. The account URL must be HTTPS (loopback excepted) with no credentials, query or fragment, validated once at startup rather than per call. Payment headers are stripped by pattern rather than exact name, so a new x402 spelling cannot ride along on a rail that signs nothing.

**A malformed key is now fatal instead of skipped.** Skipping fell through to the _next_ credential, and the next credential can be a different account or a funded wallet — spending USDC because a key file was corrupt is worse than refusing to start. An empty `BLOCKRUN_API_KEY` still counts as unset, since `FOO=""` is the ordinary way to clear a variable in CI.

Authenticated responses carry `Cache-Control: no-store`, keyed on the credential rather than the route: downstream caches key on URL, so two API keys on one proxy port could otherwise share `/v1/phone/numbers` — which answers "which numbers do I own" and which upstream marks `public, max-age=3600`.

Account-rail async jobs (`202` + `poll_url`) are driven to completion by polling the signed URL, never by resubmitting — a resubmit would be a second _paid_ job. And the long tail of non-chat account services is forwarded verbatim and streamed, so payload, status and SSE contract survive.

### Fixed — image, video and audio calls were journaled at $0 on the API-key rail

The media branches computed their cost as `paymentStore.getStore()?.amountUsd ?? <estimate>`, and `??` does not catch **0**. On the API-key rail no x402 payment happens, the store reports `0`, and `0 ?? estimate` is `0` — so every image, img2img, audio and video call landed in the journal at zero and `/stats` showed `IMAGE: {count: 4, cost: 0}` while the account was really charged $0.0525 per image.

The same shape as the 152x chat overstatement fixed in v0.12.271, in the other direction: spend that silently is not there. Found by the ClawRouter-Hermes session live-testing 0.12.271, not by a test — `??` versus `||` on a legitimately-zero value is invisible to typecheck and to every test that only exercises the wallet rail.

These routes are luckier than the rest: the gateway puts the settled amount in the response body as `price.amount`, so the true figure is recoverable even where the cost header is absent. All six media sites now resolve cost in order — the `x-blockrun-cost-usd` header, then `price.amount`, then a **non-zero** x402 payment, then the local estimate as a last resort — and record the gateway request id so these calls are reconcilable too.

Verified live: one `google/nano-banana` image now journals `cost: 0.0525` with a request id, against `0` before.

### Added — `clawrouter reconcile`, so a bill can be checked without a dashboard

Two records of the same spend exist and they are not the same thing: the local journal is what ClawRouter _believed_ each call cost, and BlockRun's ledger is what it actually _charged_. Until now the only way to see the second was to log into the portal.

`clawrouter reconcile` diffs them, joined on the gateway's own request id (recorded per call since the previous release). It reports amount mismatches, charges with no local record, local records with no settled charge, and rows still pending pricing — which are excluded from the totals rather than counted as a settled $0, since a pending charge can still be repriced.

Run against this session's own traffic it immediately re-found both billing bugs fixed in v0.12.271, from the ledger side: a `gpt-4o-mini` call journalled at `$0.001000` against `$0.000007` actually charged, and `surf/market/price` journalled at `$0` against `$0.0075`. That is the point of it — a local price table can always drift, and only the ledger settles the argument.

Exits `2` when the gateway charged for calls this machine has no record of, so a scheduled check can alert on it. That case is expected when one key is shared across machines or products, and worth investigating when it is not.

Journal entries with no request id — free models, cache hits, anything written before ids were recorded — are counted and reported separately rather than shown as discrepancies. Absence of a join key is not a mismatch.

### Added — warn before the account credit runs out, not after

A card-paying user had no warning at all: the first sign of trouble was a call failing with `402`, while wallet users have had a live balance all along. BlockRun now publishes `x-blockrun-credit-remaining-usd`, and ClawRouter warns once when it drops to $1.00 or below — the same threshold the wallet rail uses — re-arming after a top-up so the next drop is reported too. Once per crossing, not once per call, so a busy agent does not get the same line on every request.

Two properties of the header decide whether it is safe to act on, and both are honoured. **Absent means "nothing to report", never zero**: the gateway omits it entirely on ungated accounts, which have no allowance to run down, so reading absence as `0` would announce "credit exhausted" at an account with no limit at all. A genuine zero balance is written `0.000000`, and the parser keeps the two distinguishable by returning `number | undefined`. The figure is also derived net of every concurrent in-flight hold, so it can understate what is left but never overstate it — for a warning that is the right error direction.

`Number("")` is `0`, not `NaN`, so an empty header value would otherwise parse as a settled zero. Empty, malformed and negative all read as absent.

### Fixed — "the 402 quote is always authoritative" was wrong across rails

A heading in `skills/surf/SKILL.md` said a 402 quote is _always_ authoritative. The paragraph under it scoped that to the wallet rail; the heading did not, and a heading is what an agent skims. The API-key rail issues no 402 at all, and a wallet-rail quote includes the chain transaction fee that account credit does not pay — so carrying a Base 402 across quotes $0.0085 for something billed $0.0075. That mistake was made for real by another BlockRun client the same day.

Now scoped: authoritative **for the rail that issued it, and only that rail**, with an explicit warning against reading one rail's quote as the other's price.

Both files also now state that the Base/Solana Surf difference is deliberate — the $0.001 is Base's transaction fee and Solana omitting it is a migration incentive. Solana being _cheaper_ is expected; Solana priced **above** Base would be the bug worth reporting, since estimates generally assume the Base figure is the ceiling. Two sessions filed the spread as a defect before it was written down.

## v0.12.271 — September 5, 2026

### Fixed — API-key calls were logged at up to 152x their real cost

On the wallet rail `logUsage` records the actual x402 payment. On the API-key rail no x402 payment ever happens, so `actualPayment` was always 0 and every call fell through to a local estimate that adds a 5% server margin, a $0.001 per-transaction settlement fee and router-core's `MIN_PAYMENT_USD` floor. All three are x402 concepts — the fee covers on-chain gas, the floor is the CDP facilitator's minimum — and account credit settles none of them.

Measured against the gateway's own ledger by diffing `spent_usd` across a single call: a 12-in/8-out `gpt-4o-mini` call was billed **$0.0000066** while `/stats` reported **$0.001**. API-key mode now prices a call the way the gateway does, using the token counts the response actually reports: `(inputTokens × inputPrice + outputTokens × outputPrice) / 1e6`. Re-measured after the fix — gateway charged $0.00000675, ClawRouter logged $0.00000675, delta zero.

**If you pay by API key, the numbers `/stats` reports will drop sharply after upgrading.** The old ones were wrong; the new ones reconcile against the gateway to the cent. Wallet mode is unchanged — it still logs the real x402 amount.

### Fixed — paid partner calls were logged at $0 on the API-key rail

The mirror of the same bug. `getActualPaymentUsd()` returns the x402 payment, which never happens on the API-key rail, so Surf, Exa, prediction-market, image and speech calls all landed in the journal at zero and were invisible in `/stats`. Unlike chat there is no local price model for these services, so the gateway's own figure is the only truthful source: ClawRouter now reads `x-blockrun-cost-usd` when BlockRun sends it.

Its contract is that **absent means "no charge settled at response time", not "the call was free"** — chat is always absent, since the charge commits after the response is sent — so absence falls back rather than asserting $0.

### Added — `clawrouter status` shows account credit

BlockRun now publishes a key-readable credit position, so the balance a card-paying user could previously only see by logging into the dashboard is available from the CLI, and on `/health?full=true`.

`remaining_usd` is legitimately null on an ungated account (no prepaid allowance), so it renders as `spent $4.29 — no prepaid limit` rather than a fabricated `$0.00`; a prepaid account shows `$12.50 remaining (spent $4.29)`. Also surfaces the account's blocked flag.

### Added — the gateway request id is recorded for billing reconciliation

Every `cost` in the usage journal is a local estimate, so it drifts whenever the local price table does. Reconciling against a server-side ledger needs a key both sides share, and the gateway already returns one on every response. `UsageEntry.requestId` now captures it. It cannot be backfilled, so it is recorded ahead of the ledger API that will consume it.

### Fixed — every paid Solana call failed on hosts that cannot reach the public Solana RPC

Signing an x402 payment on Solana fetches the asset's mint account from a Solana RPC, defaulting to `api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`. A host with blocked egress — or one the public node refuses — therefore failed **every** paid Solana call with a bare `fetch failed`, while the gateway itself answered fine and free models kept working. Indistinguishable from a gateway outage, and the reason [ClawRouter-Hermes#38](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter-Hermes/issues/38) looked like a Solana gateway fault.

`CLAWROUTER_SOLANA_RPC_URL` now applies to payment signing, not just the balance monitor. `registerExactSvmScheme` cannot forward an RPC (it constructs `new ExactSvmScheme(config.signer)` and drops the rest), so the override re-registers `solana:*` and the v1 compat networks directly; `_registerScheme` keys on version+network+scheme, so the later registration wins and everything else the helper sets up survives.

`describeFetchError` also unwraps undici's three-word `fetch failed` into the errno, host and port it hides on `cause`, so the failing endpoint is named in both the response body and the proxy log rather than left to guesswork.

### Fixed — the gateway request id was read under a name two of the three gateways don't use

`blockrunRequestId()` read only `x-blockrun-request-id`. Measured across the three gateways: `api.blockrun.ai` sends that plus `x-request-id` and `request-id`; **`sol.blockrun.ai` sends `x-request-id` only**; `blockrun.ai` sends none at all.

Two consequences, both real. The reconciliation join key added in `f927cd8` was silently always-undefined on **both wallet rails** — it only ever worked on the API-key rail, which is where it was tested. And a failing paid call had no id to report, which is exactly what the #38 reporter hit: a paid 500 with nothing to hand anyone, on either side.

The failure path now carries the id through to the caller — appended to the `All N models failed` log line and returned as an `x-blockrun-request-id` response header, because whoever hits this is usually reading an agent transcript rather than our proxy log.

Two theories ruled out while investigating, recorded so they are not re-tested: the reporter's low SOL balance is not the trigger (a wallet holding **0.0 SOL** settles paid calls fine — the facilitator pays the fee), and their wallet is healthy on-chain (USDC ATA initialized, standard Tokenkeg program).

## v0.12.270 — September 5, 2026

### Fixed — the Grok rate sync was docs-only; the code still quoted the old prices

`d9fb986` corrected three Grok rows in the README and stopped there. `src/models.ts` still carried the pre-repricing numbers, and it carried them for **six** SKUs, not three — the README had also been left stale on `gemini-3.6-flash` and both `gpt-5.6-sol` tiers. Diffed against the live gateway catalog:

| Model                     | Was           | Now               |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| `openai/gpt-5.6-sol`      | $5 / $30      | **$4 / $20**      |
| `openai/gpt-5.6-sol-pro`  | $5 / $30      | **$4 / $20**      |
| `google/gemini-3.6-flash` | $1.50 / $7.50 | **$0.75 / $3.75** |
| `xai/grok-4.3`            | $1.50 / $4.00 | **$1.25 / $2.50** |
| `xai/grok-4.5`            | $2.50 / $9.00 | **$2.00 / $6.00** |
| `xai/grok-build-0.1`      | $1.50 / $3.00 | **$1.00 / $2.00** |

Not cosmetic: `inputPrice`/`outputPrice` are published through `GET /v1/models` (which Pi persists into `~/.pi/agent/models.json`, so a wrong number becomes durable downstream), drive per-request cost accounting behind `/stats`, and feed the pre-flight estimate behind balance pre-checks and `maxCostPerRun` — overstated output by up to 50%, so strict mode could refuse a Grok request that was actually affordable.

`src/top-models.json` carries no prices and needed no change. A repo-vs-gateway diff over the whole catalog now reports zero drift across 100 live entries.

### Fixed — API-key mode could still mint a wallet you never asked for

`resolveOrGenerateWalletKey()` creates a private key as a side effect, so every call site has to resolve the BlockRun API key first. Three of the four did. The fourth — the plugin's non-gateway-mode branch of `register()` — called it unconditionally, so a card-paying user installing the OpenClaw plugin got a freshly minted key plus a `NEW WALLET GENERATED — BACK UP YOUR KEY NOW / losing this key = losing your USDC` banner for a wallet that would never be used. That contradicted the documented promise that API-key mode "never generates, reads or signs with a private key". The branch now resolves the key first and returns before touching a wallet, and `src/index.api-key-no-wallet.test.ts` guards every call site so a fifth one cannot be added unguarded.

### Fixed — endpoints the gateway serves returned "All models in fallback chain failed"

Every `/v1/*` path the proxy did not explicitly route fell through to the chat handler, whose attempt loop is `modelsToTry = modelId ? [modelId] : []`. A body with no routable `model` therefore produced an empty chain, issued **no upstream request at all**, and answered `502 All models in fallback chain failed` — blaming the model catalog for what was really an unrouted URL.

Two real endpoints were caught by this in **both wallet and API-key mode**:

- `/v1/messages` — the Anthropic-shaped chat surface, which the README already listed as supported
- `/v1/audio/speech` — TTS, distinct from the `/v1/audio/generations` music route that _was_ handled

Both now forward verbatim through the existing paid-passthrough, verified live against `api.blockrun.ai` and `blockrun.ai/api`. Anything still unrouted gets an honest `404 unsupported_endpoint` naming what the proxy does serve, instead of a misleading 502.

### Fixed — the API-key docs described a gateway that no longer exists

The 404 hint and the README both said `api.blockrun.ai` "currently carries chat and text completions" and that "image, video, audio and the partner APIs are still wallet-only". Probing the live gateway on 2026-09-05 disproved it: chat, `/v1/messages`, `/v1/models`, image generation, speech, video, Surf, Exa, prediction markets and phone lookup/fraud **all work on an API key**, and so do all <!-- br:models.free -->7<!-- /br:models.free --> free models. The genuine wallet-only exceptions are the routes that bind a lease or a position to a payer address — buying/renewing/releasing phone numbers, and Polymarket trading — and those are now what the hint names.

### Changed — Solana is the stated preference, without stranding Base wallets

New installs have persisted `payment-chain=solana` since v0.12.246, but everything that _described_ the product still led with Base, and `loadPaymentChain()` fell back to `base` for any install with no chain file. That fallback now resolves to **solana** — except when a wallet already exists on disk (or in `BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY`), where it stays on **base**, because a pre-v0.12.246 install has its USDC in the Base wallet and flipping it would point every call at a gateway its money is not on. An explicitly recorded choice and `CLAWROUTER_PAYMENT_CHAIN` still win over both. README, docs and skills now name Solana first.

### Changed — skills no longer assume a wallet

Every skill told the agent "payment is deducted from the user's BlockRun wallet" and, on a 402, "tell the user to fund their wallet at blockrun.ai" — advice that sends a card-paying user to a page that cannot fix their error. `imagegen`, `phone`, `surf`, `predexon` and `clawrouter` now describe both rails and tell the agent to read `authMode` from `GET /health` before naming a fix. The `phone` skill also records that wallet-owned number leases are wallet-mode only.

### Changed — README says where to sign up

The card rail is now signposted from the hero, the pay-rails table, the funding list and the support table, with the actual top-up fee (5.5% + $0.30, charged once at purchase, then provider list price with nothing per call).

---

## v0.12.269 — September 4, 2026

### Fixed — one spend ledger for every signing surface, and a `session` cap that still means what the docs say

The proxy, the Polymarket tool and `doctor` each constructed their own `SpendControl`. Amount windows were therefore enforced once per surface, and `saveHistory()` was last-writer-wins on disk: LLM spend through the proxy did not count against a Polymarket order, and either could overwrite the other's history. `getSharedSpendControl()` is now the single default; `startProxy`, `buildPolymarketTool`, `createDoctorX402Client` and `/policy`'s `liveControl` all resolve to it. Injection is unchanged — every surface still accepts an explicit `spendControl`.

The ledger lives on `process`, not in a module variable, for the same reason the startup flags do: a global install and an npm-projects install can both be resolved in one gateway, and two module copies each holding their own singleton would enforce every window twice over.

**One trap the shared ledger opened, closed in the same release.** `sessionSpent` is instance state that is never persisted, so `session` used to reset by accident — every `startProxy()` built a fresh `SpendControl`. A ledger that outlives an in-process restart quietly redefines `session` as "since the gateway booted", and leaves it asymmetric: a gateway restart still reset it, an in-process restart no longer did. `docs/configuration.md` and the `/policy` help both promise "session resets on restart", and `supersedeEmptyConfigStartup` puts ordinary boots through two starts, so this was not a corner case. The restart path now calls `resetSession()` on purpose. History and the rolling hourly/daily windows still survive, which is the point of sharing the ledger.

Also in this area:

- A torn or unreadable `spending.json` no longer gets **overwritten with empty limits** by a history save. `load()` throws `UnreadableSpendPolicyError` instead of returning null, and both writers leave the file alone. A reload keeps enforcing the limits already in effect rather than widening what the agent may pay because a read failed.
- `buildPolymarketTool()` takes no deps at the registration site. It was handed `getSharedSpendControl()`, which is exactly what the tool already falls back to — so the argument bought nothing and cost a synchronous read of `spending.json` on every plugin registration, including the installs that never place a bet.

### Fixed — `onPayment` actually fires

`ProxyOptions.onPayment` was public, documented, and invoked nowhere. It now fires at the layer that owns both paid paths — the normal 402 → signed retry, and the cached pre-auth → paid first request — gated on the v2 `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` or v1 `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` settlement header, so a rejected 402 does not fire it. An observer that throws is contained after settlement: its failure must not turn a paid response into a retryable request and risk a second charge.

The API-key rail does not notify, deliberately: it is billed server-side against account credit, so there is no per-request settlement for an observer to report.

### Added — the README says what BlockRun is

The README explained ClawRouter thoroughly and mentioned BlockRun exactly once, in passing, as the thing that issues API keys. **BlockRun lets agents pay for the outcome — every LLM, tool and data source, best value per dollar.** That definition now leads, before "Why ClawRouter exists", with the surface behind each claim and a `What is BlockRun?` FAQ entry. Every figure is a brand-numbers marker, including three new to the file (`models.video`, `models.speech`, `chains.rpc`).

### Fixed — a `node_modules` symlink was committed to the repo

v0.12.268's follow-up merge carried `node_modules` into git as a **symlink to an absolute path on one machine**. Pulling main dropped that link into your working tree, where it shadows the real install and breaks `npm ci`, `tsup` and every `.bin/*` lookup with "too many levels of symbolic links". Untracked here, with `.gitignore` now listing both `node_modules/` and `node_modules` — the trailing slash matches a directory and only a directory, which is exactly how a symlink of that name got past it.

If you pulled `main` between v0.12.268 and this release, run `rm -f node_modules && npm ci` once. npm package installs were never affected: `files` in `package.json` is an allowlist and never included it.

Thanks to @twzrd-sol for the shared spend ledger (#322 → #331) and the `onPayment` fix (#321, #325 → #330). Both branches were rebased onto the v0.12.268 API-key rail and landed with their authorship preserved.

## v0.12.268 — September 3, 2026

### Added — API keys, so a person can pay with a card instead of a wallet

BlockRun now runs a customer portal at **user.blockrun.ai** and an OpenAI-compatible gateway at **api.blockrun.ai**: sign in, top up with a credit card, mint a `brk_live_…` key. ClawRouter speaks that rail now, alongside x402.

Wallets remain the default and the reason ClawRouter exists — an agent that can sign a transaction can pay for itself with no account anywhere. But that is a bad answer for a person who just wants to use the router, and "get USDC onto Base or Solana first" was the whole onboarding for them. Both rails now work, and they are one command apart:

```bash
clawrouter login brk_live_...   # bill account credit via api.blockrun.ai
clawrouter logout               # back to signing x402 payments from the wallet
```

Or `BLOCKRUN_API_KEY=brk_live_…` for CI and containers, or the plugin's new `apiKey` config field. Resolution order is env → `~/.blockrun/.api-key` (shared with other BlockRun products) → `~/.openclaw/blockrun/api-key`.

**A key wins over a wallet whenever both are present.** A machine holding a legacy wallet and a key the user just added means "bill my account", not "keep spending my USDC" — and nothing is deleted, so `clawrouter logout` reverses it.

What changes inside the proxy is narrower than it sounds. In API-key mode `startProxy` builds no x402 client, registers no EVM or Solana signer and installs no pre-sign spend hook — there is nothing to sign — and the upstream fetch attaches a bearer token instead of settling a 402. Everything downstream of that is untouched: the same model ids, the same 15-dimension classifier, the same fallback chains, `/exclude`, `maxCostPerRun`, the response cache and the OpenAI-compatible surface.

Three things were deliberate rather than obvious:

- **The bearer token REPLACES the client's `authorization` header, it does not default to it.** The proxy forwards request headers verbatim, and OpenClaw and the OpenAI SDK both send a placeholder key. Setting rather than defaulting is the difference between working and 401-ing every call.
- **No wallet is generated in API-key mode, by any path.** `resolveOrGenerateWalletKey()` mints a private key as a side effect, so both the CLI and the plugin resolve the API key _before_ touching it — and `clawrouter doctor` does too. A customer paying by card must never find a key they did not ask for and a "back this up now" banner they cannot act on.
- **There is no local balance gate, on purpose.** api.blockrun.ai publishes no key-readable balance and the account's books live server-side, so ClawRouter does not guess: it makes the call, and a `402 insufficient_quota` naming the top-up page is the answer when credit runs out. Guessing zero would have silently downgraded a paying customer to the free tier, which is what the wallet-mode fallback does when a wallet is empty.

`/health` reports `authMode` with the key masked and no payment chain, and two ClawRouters on one port now refuse to reuse each other across auth modes — the same rule that already applied across chains, for the same reason: they bill different accounts.

api.blockrun.ai currently carries `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`, `GET /v1/models` and `GET /v1/images/models`. Media and partner endpoints stay wallet-only for now; ClawRouter passes every path through and rewrites the gateway's `Unsupported endpoint` 404 into an explanation, so they light up on this rail the day BlockRun publishes them, with no ClawRouter release needed. 401 and 402 get the same treatment — the portal URL that fixes them, appended to the gateway's own message, with the status and error `code` an SDK branches on left untouched.

---

## v0.12.267 — September 2, 2026

### Fixed — a lost response on the pre-auth path could sign a second payment

`payment-preauth.ts` reuses a cached authorization to skip the 402 round trip. The `try` around that fast path wrapped not only the signing but the send that already carried the signed payment, and its `catch` fell through to the normal flow — which requests a fresh challenge and signs a **new** authorization.

So when the pre-auth send failed _after_ the gateway had received and settled the payment — a connection reset, a socket hang-up, a TLS error, an upstream that closes after settling — the client could not tell that from "the request never arrived". It took the second reading and paid again. One user request, two USDC charges.

Nothing else caught it. The proxy's 30-second response dedup keys on the request body and catches a client retrying a whole request, but this double payment happens inside a single `payFetch` call, so no second proxy request ever exists. Replay protection cannot help either: the second charge is a genuinely fresh authorization with an unused nonce, so every guard correctly passes it.

The ambiguity is now resolved the safe way. Once a request carrying a signed payment has left the process, a failure surfaces to the caller instead of silently authorizing another one. A 402 still falls through, because a 402 is an answer — the gateway declined the payment, so nothing settled and re-signing is safe — and a signing failure before anything is sent still falls through too, since no payment can have been made. The cost is that a transient network error on the pre-auth send now fails the request rather than retrying it invisibly, which is the right trade when the alternative is charging twice.

The existing tests could not have caught this: the harness only ever made a paid request _return_ a 402, never _reject_, so the branch was exercised for signing failures only — exactly what its comment described. Both cases are covered now.

Reported by @aurumflux20, with the analysis of why the dedup, abort and replay guards each miss it (#317).

## v0.12.266 — September 2, 2026

### Added — ClawRouter Desktop, a macOS control plane for local coding agents

A macOS app under `apps/desktop` that connects OpenClaw, Codex, Hermes, DeepSeek Harness and Pi to a local ClawRouter in one click: it installs and supervises the proxy, writes each agent's provider config, and restores the original on disconnect. It also shows Base and Solana USDC balances, switches the payment chain, and opens a wallet-bound Coinbase Onramp.

The app ships outside the npm package — `@blockrun/clawrouter` is unchanged in size and contents — and the packaged build stages a frozen, version-pinned runtime so the UI and the router cannot drift apart. It is an unsigned developer preview; Developer ID signing and notarization are still release-pipeline work.

The security surface was reviewed rather than assumed: `contextIsolation` on, `nodeIntegration` off, `sandbox` on, `will-navigate` and `setWindowOpenHandler` both guarded, a CSP in the renderer, every IPC handler behind a trusted-renderer check plus a parser, no shell in process spawning, config writes at `0600` with a symlink-cycle guard, and no private key or mnemonic ever reaching the renderer. Agent configuration additionally requires an authenticated proxy identity and proof that the process holding the port is the one Desktop spawned.

### Changed — `/v1/models` now serves the real catalog metadata

`GET /v1/models` returned four fields (`id`, `object`, `created`, `owned_by`). It now also carries `name`, `context_window`, `max_output`, `input_price`, `output_price`, `reasoning`, `vision`, `agentic` and `tool_calling`, resolved through the alias map to the canonical registry entry.

This replaced a 2,441-line catalog that had been bundled into the Desktop app. That copy had drifted to 197 field disagreements across 110 ids — 16 of them understating price, `claude-opus-5` and the whole `gpt-5.6` family missing outright, and six of the seven free models absent. Pi persists these values into `~/.pi/agent/models.json`, where a wrong `vision` flag makes an image-capable model text-only, so the drift was durable rather than cosmetic. Deleting the bundle removes the class of bug instead of refreshing one instance of it.

### Fixed — the plugin-id migration is back on the gateway-start path

v0.12.265 migrated the renamed plugin id on every gateway start. That had moved to `clawrouter setup`/`update`/`reinstall` only, which left `npm update -g` followed by a gateway restart unmigrated — the same silent non-load v0.12.265 shipped to fix.

It runs from the config-injection hook again, where the write is already behind the gateway-mode guard and so cannot trip OpenClaw's install-time `baseHash` rollback. It fires only when BlockRun-owned fields prove the legacy entry is ours, so OpenClaw's own bundled `clawrouter` entry is never touched on the strength of its id alone.

### Fixed — the install scripts no longer widen `openclaw.json` to `0644`

The `atomicWrite` helper embedded in `scripts/reinstall.sh` and `scripts/update.sh` wrote its temp file at the default mode and let `rename` carry it onto the target. Probed on macOS: `600` before, `644` after. That file can hold a wallet private key — `openclaw.plugin.json` declares `walletKey` as sensitive, and these scripts move it between plugin entries. Every write now passes `{ mode: 0o600 }` and re-`chmod`s after the rename.

### Added — `clawrouter policy` and `/policy`

`SpendControl`'s limits and counterparty lists were library-only: configuring them meant hand-editing `spending.json`. One implementation now backs both a CLI subcommand and a plugin command, with all validation ahead of any write, so a rejected argument leaves the file byte-identical. `/policy` reaches the live signer while a proxy is running rather than only the copy on disk, and limit writes are compare-and-swap, so a stale writer cannot clobber a concurrent update.

Emptying an allow-list is refused rather than silently performed — an emptied `allowedPayees` stops meaning "only these" and starts meaning "everyone" — and every write that leaves a key unset now says what becomes permitted as a result.

### Housekeeping

- Desktop balance reads are cached with stale-on-error fallback instead of hitting shared public RPC endpoints on every 15-second refresh.
- Runtime installs are version-pinned and run with `--ignore-scripts`; CLI preflight `openclaw` calls are bounded by a timeout.
- Read-only wallet commands no longer create a wallet as a side effect, and rollback reporting distinguishes an actual rollback from a preflight failure.

Thanks to @KillerQueen-Z for the Desktop control plane and the plugin-config migration, which corrected two real bugs in the v0.12.265 migration — it had deleted `plugins.entries.clawrouter`, a key that belongs to OpenClaw's bundled plugin after the rename, and renamed `plugins.installs.clawrouter` into a key upstream wants removed (#313). Thanks to @twzrd-sol for the policy surface (#303, closes #301).

## v0.12.265 — September 2, 2026

### Fixed — the plugin silently never loaded on OpenClaw 2026.7.1 and newer

OpenClaw bundles its own plugin under the id `clawrouter` since the 2026.7.1 line. This plugin declared the same id, so OpenClaw resolved the duplicate in favour of the bundled one:

```text
duplicate plugin id detected; global plugin will be overridden by bundled plugin
pluginId: clawrouter
```

BlockRun's plugin never loaded. `clawrouter setup` reported success, `openclaw plugins list` showed only the bundled plugin, and the local proxy on `127.0.0.1:8402` was never started. They are separate products: OpenClaw's uses `clawrouter/*`, `CLAWROUTER_API_KEY` and a hosted endpoint; this one uses `blockrun/*`, a local proxy and a self-custodial wallet.

Confirmed against the published artifact, not the report alone — `openclaw@2026.8.2` vendors `dist/extensions/clawrouter/package.json` (`@openclaw/clawrouter`) declaring `id: "clawrouter"`. Worth recording the trap: `npm view @openclaw/clawrouter` 404s and it is not a dependency of `openclaw`, so a dependency check wrongly says there is no collision. Only unpacking the tarball shows it.

The plugin id is now `blockrun-clawrouter`, display name **BlockRun ClawRouter**. The npm package (`@blockrun/clawrouter`), the CLI command (`clawrouter`) and the install directory are deliberately unchanged — none of them collide, and changing them would strand every existing install.

**Existing installs are migrated on the next gateway start.** A pre-rename config carries the old id in up to three places, and all three are handled:

- `plugins.entries` — moved to the new key, preserving the enabled/disabled choice. Left alone it would have explicitly enabled _OpenClaw's_ router while this plugin lost its entry.
- `plugins.allow` — the new id is **added**. This list is an exclusive allowlist ("the installed plugin id must be in that list before the plugin can load"), so a user who had allow-listed the old id would otherwise have had this plugin blocked outright. The old id is left in place, since it may now also be permitting OpenClaw's bundled plugin.
- `plugins.deny` — mirrored, so an explicit decision to keep this plugin off is honoured rather than silently reversed.
- `plugins.installs` — renamed outright; install provenance is unambiguously ours.

The write goes through the existing gateway-mode guard, so it cannot trip the install-time `baseHash` rollback. Probed against real OpenClaw 2026.5.2: the renamed config loads (exit 0, `blockrun` provider still effective).

Reported by @KillerQueen-Z (#305).

### Fixed — a synced brand script would have made the package uninstallable

`scripts/sync-brand-numbers.mjs`, vendored from blockrun, now shells out to `git ls-files` to honour its own "only git-tracked files are rewritten" contract. That pulls in `node:child_process`, and everything under `scripts/` ships in the npm tarball — which OpenClaw's plugin scanner rejects, the same failure that made v0.12.222 uninstallable.

`scripts/smoke-dist.mjs` caught it and refused the build before publish. The script is now excluded from the tarball via `package.json` `files`, as `smoke-dist.mjs` already was. It is a CI tool; npm consumers never run it (#306).

---

## v0.12.264 — September 2, 2026

### Fixed — five signing paths spent the user's capital without consulting the spend policy

`registerSpendPolicyHook` had exactly one call site, on the proxy's x402 client. Five other places signed with the same wallet and never consulted it, so a strict `allowedPayees` / `allowedNetworks` list refused every payee on the proxy while governing nothing here: `doctor`'s paid probe, and the Polymarket fund, order, withdraw and redeem paths.

All five now run the same check before the signer, throwing the proxy's `SpendPolicyError` if the counterparty or amount is refused. The withdraw gate is the notable one: policy sees the **destination** leg (the agent-chosen `to_address`, Base, USDC) rather than the one-time bridge address, because the bridge cannot be allowlisted and `to_address` is what an operator's payee list has to govern.

Amounts are canonicalised to micro-USDC and fail closed: `NaN`, `Infinity`, negatives and values past `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` all fail the `/^\d+$/` check and are refused whenever any amount cap is configured.

The one-time approval batch in `setup.ts` stays deliberately ungated, and now says so in the module header. Gating it would be actively harmful — the spenders are Polymarket's own exchange contracts, so an operator running a tight `allowedPayees` list naming only their payout addresses would have setup refused. It is bounded already: targets come from `readApprovals()`, never agent input, and it is confirm-gated behind an explicit preview.

Thanks to @twzrd-sol (#304).

### Fixed — non-positive and non-numeric `amount_usd` reached the Polymarket signer

`executeTrade()`'s market-buy path and `withdrawFunds()` accepted any `amount_usd`. A negative became the order's notional, and since `reserveBet()` is `ledger.totalUsd += notional`, a negative _lowered_ the running total — leaving `ledger.totalUsd + notional > sessionCap` satisfiable indefinitely and silently defeating `POLYMARKET_MAX_SESSION_USD` for every later order. On withdraw, `amountRaw > balanceRaw` is false for zero or negative, so it sailed past the balance check into the bridge transfer.

Both now reject with `Number.isFinite(x) && x > 0`, not merely `x <= 0`. Nothing validates these fields at runtime — `tool.ts` hands them over as `params.amount_usd as number | undefined`, a compile-time cast over `Record<string, unknown>` — so `NaN` and strings arrive intact and both `NaN <= 0` and `"abc" <= 0` are false. That case was worse than the negative one: a `NaN` notional poisons `ledger.totalUsd` permanently, because `totalUsd + NaN > cap` stays false forever.

Limit orders are covered too. Their notional is `price * size`, and the existing minimum-size check could not catch a negative: `book.min_order_size` is often absent, so `parseFloat(undefined || "0")` is `0` and the `minSize > 0` term short-circuits the guard. The new check sits in the cross-field block, before any network call.

Thanks to @erhnysr (#294).

### Fixed — a stray code-block indent turned CI red for every open PR

The v0.12.263 CHANGELOG used aligned trailing comments inside a fenced block, which Prettier collapses, so `prettier --check .` failed on `main` and every PR branched from it inherited a red `Lint & Typecheck` (#300).

---

## v0.12.263 — September 1, 2026

### Fixed — a live-clock race let in-flight reservations vanish from the spend caps

`SpendControl.getSpendingInWindow()` decided whether in-flight reservations counted toward the hourly/daily spend by reading the clock a **second** time and comparing it against a window bound the caller had already built from a **first** read:

```ts
const now = this.now(); // read #1
const hourlySpent = this.getSpendingInWindow(now - HOUR_MS, now);
// ...inside:
return recorded + (to >= this.now() ? this.pendingTotal() : 0); // read #2
```

On the production clock (`() => Date.now()`), a millisecond ticking between the two reads makes `this.now() > to`, the guard goes false, and the whole pending total is silently dropped from the figure the cap is checked against. Reservations are the concurrency-safety mechanism — the x402 pre-sign hook does check-then-`reserve()` synchronously precisely so two concurrent payments cannot both clear the same remaining budget. With the pending total missing, they can: a $5 hold disappears and a second $5 payment sees the full $5 of an already-exhausted $5 cap.

The caller's single `now` is threaded through instead. Every existing test injected a frozen clock, so the two reads always matched and the sub-millisecond window went uncaught; there is now a live-clock test.

### Fixed — `?days=` on /stats silently zeroed or mislabeled the report

`GET /stats?days=` ran user input through `parseInt(...)` then `Math.min(days, 30)`, and both steps pass bad input straight through JS's numeric coercion. `?days=abc` became `NaN`, survived `Math.min`, and turned `getStats`' `slice(0, NaN)` into `slice(0, 0)` — the endpoint reported **zero usage** instead of falling back to the default window. `?days=-1` survived `Math.min(-1, 30)`, and `slice(0, -1)` **dropped the newest day** while the response labelled itself "last -1 days".

A single `resolveStatsDays()` guard (mirroring the existing `resolveMaxTokens` precedent) covers non-numeric, `NaN`, zero and negative alike. Local, read-only diagnostic endpoint — wrong numbers, not a security boundary.

### Fixed — `logs --days -1` dropped the newest day instead of showing more history

The sibling of the above on the path that does **not** go over HTTP. `clawrouter logs --days <n>` parses with `parseInt(raw, 10) || 1`; `NaN` is falsy so a typo fell back to 1, but a **negative is truthy** and reached `logFiles.slice(0, days)`. Log files are newest-first and a negative second argument to `slice` trims from the end, so `--days -1` cut the **newest** day — the opposite of asking for more history — and the header rendered "last -1 days".

Guarded at the sink in `formatRecentLogs` rather than at the CLI parse site, so every caller is covered rather than the one that happens to exist today. Worth recording: `clawrouter stats --days` sends `/stats?days=` over HTTP and was therefore already covered by the `resolveStatsDays` guard above; `logs` reads the files locally and was the one path left uncovered.

- Thanks to @erhnysr for the spend-control clock race (#286) and the `/stats` window validation (#285).

---

## v0.12.262 — August 31, 2026

### Added — four live catalog models that were never in the picker

`google/gemini-3.6-flash`, `google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, `tencent/hy3` and `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro` have had entries in `src/models.ts` and have been visible in the live BlockRun catalog, but none of them was ever added to `src/top-models.json`. Everything that curates against that file — the picker, and every downstream consumer of `TOP_MODELS` — has been blind to all four.

Placement follows the existing grouping, with no reordering of current entries: the two Gemini flash tiers beside their siblings, `mimo-v2.5-pro` after `mimo-v2.5`, `hy3` after the Qwen pair. 51 → 55 entries.

Surfaced from downstream. ClawRouter-Hermes curates its Telegram/gateway picker against this file and had to park all four in an exemption set to get its own mirror guard green ([Hermes #32](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter-Hermes/pull/32)); that exemption is now removed, and the two catalogs are identical entry for entry and in order.

---

## v0.12.261 — August 31, 2026

### Fixed — image requests were skipping the cheapest model that can handle them

`google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` reads images. blockrun's catalog does not tag it, so ClawRouter did not either, and `filterByVision()` excluded the **cheapest paid model in the catalog** ($0.10/$0.40) from every request carrying an `image_url`. Image turns escalated past it to something dearer. It is also router-core's eco SIMPLE cheapest-paid rung, so the eco profile felt this most.

Verified before flagging, not taken on report: 3 of 3 proxy probes with a 64×64 solid-red PNG answered "Red", each served as itself.

The four other models flagged as under-tagged upstream — `claude-sonnet-4.6`, `claude-opus-4.5`, `claude-haiku-4.5`, `gemini-2.5-flash` — already carried `vision: true` here; ClawRouter has been ahead of blockrun's catalog on those since v0.12.233.

### Confirmed — the free tier still has no working vision

Re-probed both free models on Base with the same fixture: `llama-3.2-11b-vision` 0 of 3 ("I'm unable to see the image"), `nemotron-3-nano-omni` 0 of 3 ("white" for red twice). Base still strips image parts on the NVIDIA paths. The flags stay off, as shipped in v0.12.259.

Two independent corrections arrived from the Solana gateway's owner that sharpen the record: `nemotron-3-nano-omni` **is not a vision model and never was** — the published sheets tagging it were wrong — and the free-tier image failures trace to a gateway-side unconditional `image_url` strip, not a model limitation. Neither changes what ClawRouter ships; both mean the v0.12.259 decision was right for a better reason than the one recorded.

---

## v0.12.260 — August 31, 2026

### Fixed — the legacy auth placeholder bricked dispatch on OpenClaw 2026.8.1

`injectAuthProfile()` wrote a placeholder `agent/auth-profiles.json` into every agent directory, including the shared auth-owner (`main`). On OpenClaw 2026.8.1 the SQLite auth store is authoritative, and a leftover legacy JSON beside an **empty** store fails auth migration closed — which takes message dispatch down for the whole agent fleet:

```
AuthProfileMigrationRequiredError: Auth profile store
~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/openclaw-agent.sqlite requires legacy credential migration
```

The write is now SQLite-aware. Where `openclaw-agent.sqlite` exists the legacy JSON is never written and our own previously-injected placeholder is removed; the shared `main` directory is never written into at all; only installs with no store keep the original bootstrap. Removal is deliberately narrow — a file is deleted only when it contains **nothing but** the exact `blockrun:default` placeholder, so a real credential file is never touched.

**The rationale this replaces is now retired.** `injectAuthProfile` carried the comment "OpenClaw's agent system looks for auth credentials even if provider has `auth: []`" since it was written. Measured on 2026.5.2 before merging, via `openclaw agent --agent main --json` in three states — placeholder present, `blockrun:default` removed, and `auth-profiles.json` deleted outright — all three dispatched successfully with real token usage and zero errors. The placeholder was not load-bearing. What carries it is the `apiKey` `injectModelsConfig` writes into `openclaw.json` plus the provider's `auth: []` declaration.

One trap worth recording for anyone auditing this path: the run reports `"authMode": "auth-profile"` in all three states, **including with the file deleted**. That field describes the configured mode, not that a profile was found — it is not evidence a profile is in use.

New `src/auth.injection.test.ts` (5 tests) pins the matrix: legacy bootstrap kept with no store, `main` never written, no write beside an existing store, placeholder removed beside a store, and real credential files never removed. 797 tests pass.

- Thanks to @0xCheetah1 for the fix, the 2026.8.1 reproduction, and the before/after `openclaw doctor --lint --all` verification (#288).

---

## v0.12.259 — August 31, 2026

Corrections to v0.12.258 plus the same-night paid-catalog refresh, both found by checking claims instead of trusting catalogs. Neither would have surfaced as an error — both fail with HTTP 200.

### Fixed — the new free tier 400'd on Solana, which is the default chain for new installs

v0.12.258 rebuilt the free tier from blockrun's Base catalog. `sol.blockrun.ai` does not carry it: six of the seven return **HTTP 400 "Unknown model"** there, and only `nemotron-3-nano-omni` exists. Since v0.12.246 new installs default to Solana, so on a fresh install `/model free` and router-core's eco SIMPLE primary both pointed at a model their own gateway had never heard of.

The gateways' never-retire redirect rule does not help here — it protects ids a gateway once shipped, and these were never shipped on sol, so they hard-400 rather than falling back.

`loadGatewayCatalog()` now reads the active gateway's `/v1/models` once at startup and `pickFreeModel()` skips rungs that chain does not serve, so a Solana user degrades to the models sol actually has instead of collecting 400s. It is deliberately **advisory only**: it filters, it never chooses. The cascade head stays a committed literal because `free`, `FREE_MODELS[0]`, `FREE_MODEL` and router-core's `ecoTiers.SIMPLE.primary` must agree and `free-model-liveness.test.ts` checks that at build time — a runtime-derived head would make the invariant unverifiable. A failed or empty catalog read leaves every rung eligible: a catalog we could not read must never be able to switch the free tier off.

The blockrun-sol owner is adding the four load-bearing ids to sol's in-flight rebuild, served as themselves rather than redirected, so the two chains converge.

### Fixed — no free model claims `vision` any more; two of them were lying

v0.12.258 set `vision: true` on `nemotron-3-nano-omni` and `llama-3.2-11b-vision`, mirroring both gateways' `categories` lists. Neither holds up against a 64×64 solid-red PNG:

| model                           | result                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nemotron-3-nano-omni` (Base)   | correct **1 of 4** — the others "I'm not able to view the image" or leaked reasoning                                                                           |
| `nemotron-3-nano-omni` (Solana) | answered **"white"** for red, twice; one response's own `model` field read `nemotron-3-super-120b (fallback: …nano-omni)` — a silent fall back to a text model |
| `llama-3.2-11b-vision` (Base)   | "I'm unable to see the image" **3 of 3**, while a plain-text control on the same id answered fine                                                              |

Every one of those is an HTTP 200. The image is dropped and a confident wrong answer comes back with nothing for a caller to branch on. `vision` is not a description — it is what `filterByVision()` uses to _aim_ image turns at a model — so the flag was actively routing real traffic into that. It is now off on every free model (including the dead-but-pinnable `nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl`), and image requests go to one of the 45 paid vision models. `src/models.test.ts` pins the absence.

Worth recording how this was nearly missed: the **first** Base probe returned "Red" and I took it as verification. It took four samples to see that was luck. A catalog's capability list is a claim, not a measurement — and neither is a single sample. Independently confirmed on the Solana side by the blockrun-sol owner, who hit the same failure with the same fixture size.

### Changed — paid catalog refresh + three real price moves (blockrun #449)

Landed the same night, verified against `origin/main` rather than taken on report:

- **`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` $0.435/$0.87 → $1.32/$3.96.** A 3x rise on a model sitting in four router chains (eco COMPLEX + REASONING, premium and agentic COMPLEX). Until now every one of those calls was accumulating a third of its real cost into `maxCostPerRun`.
- `openai/gpt-5.6-terra-pro` $1/$6 → $2/$12 and `gpt-5.6-luna-pro` $0.10/$0.60 → $0.20/$1.20 — both were unroutable at the old numbers, not merely mispriced.
- Three new models, each probe-verified upstream with a real completion **and** a real image: `qwen/qwen3.8-flash` ($0.15/$0.47, 1M), `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` ($0.44/$1.32 — DeepSeek's peak rate on purpose, since off-peak is half and listing that would sell under cost on weekday mornings), and `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` ($0.14/$0.28).
- Published counts: **76 chat models** (was 73) and the `auto` savings figure **88% → 84%** — that is a real move, not a re-estimate: `auto` is costed on DeepSeek V4 Pro, which just tripled. `eco` stays 98%.

### Fixed — `mimo-v2.5` was billing 3x for the wrong model

`"mimo-v2.5"` had long been an alias for `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro`, which was harmless while nothing owned that name. blockrun then listed an actual `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` — a **different**, natively-multimodal SKU at $0.14/$0.28 against Pro's $0.435/$0.87 and text-only. The alias would have sent anyone naming the cheaper multimodal model to the pricier text-only one. Retargeted. (`mimo`, `mimo-v2.5-pro` and `xiaomi` still resolve to Pro.)

This is the near-miss worth remembering: adding a model can make an _existing_ alias wrong. Check the alias map against new ids, not just for collisions.

### Fixed — a 200 with an empty `choices` array passed through as a success

`detectDegradedSuccessResponse()` already caught a blank assistant turn, an upstream error delivered as HTTP 200, and placeholder/loop output. It did not catch `choices: []` — no answer at all — which went to the caller as a successful response. That is the shape a relay produces when it reports upstream congestion in the envelope rather than the body; blockrun measured it at roughly 3 in 15 calls on `nemotron-3-ultra-550b`, which is cascade rung 6. It now fails over like any other 5xx. Responses with no `choices` key at all (images, audio, embeddings) are untouched.

### Fixed — the startup catalog read broke four test mocks

`loadGatewayCatalog()` issues a bodyless GET to `${apiBase}/v1/models`, and four mock upstreams in the test suite called `JSON.parse` on every request body unconditionally. That throws "Unexpected end of JSON input" inside whichever test happened to be running when the read landed — it passed locally and failed CI, because the race resolves differently under load. The mocks now answer the catalog read and return instead of recording a phantom entry in the assertions. Kept the fetch unconditional: reconciling the free tier against whatever gateway the proxy points at is meaningful for any BlockRun-compatible endpoint, not just the two hosted ones.

### Verified, not changed

`cohere/north-mini-code` was reported by two other sessions as returning empty content when the token budget is tight — the theory being it spends the whole allowance reasoning and emits nothing. It does not reproduce on Base: 12 of 12 samples across `max_tokens` 200/400/1200/2000 returned non-empty content with `finish_reason: "stop"`, plus 5 of 5 clean streaming runs. Their measurements were on the Solana gateway's provider pool. Left at cascade rung 4; the empty-`choices` fix above and the existing empty-turn detection both fail it over if it does starve in the field.

`nemotron-3-ultra-550b` stays at rung 6 — low on purpose, and now covered by the empty-`choices` guard.

## v0.12.258 — August 31, 2026

### Fixed — the free tier was dead and nothing said so

NVIDIA retired **four of the five visible free models in one sweep** (blockrun #448, 2026-08-30). `step-3.7-flash`, `nemotron-nano-9b-v2` and `nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl` published HTTP 410 Gone; `mistral-nemotron` went the quiet way — still listed upstream, >150s and zero bytes. Only `nemotron-3-nano-omni` survived. `step-3.7-flash` was ClawRouter's `free` alias, `FREE_MODEL`, the head of the `FREE_MODELS` cascade **and** router-core's `ecoTiers.SIMPLE` primary.

Nothing looked broken, and that is the point: BlockRun server-redirects retired free ids, so callers kept getting answers — from a different model. That is worse than a hard failure. It **silently defeats `/exclude`** (you exclude the id you can see, the router hands the request to it anyway, and the gateway answers from the redirect target), and it misreports the envelope — `free` advertised 131K while the model actually serving has 1M.

The tier is rebuilt to blockrun's seven, each verified with a real completion through a locally-run proxy (non-streaming and streaming, `model` echoed back) rather than a catalog lookup:

| Cascade order | Model                                         | Context | Why it sits there                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | `free/nemotron-3.5-lightning`                 | 1M      | the free default — blockrun's own redirect target for the old head, so the proxy and the gateway never name different models |
| 2             | `free/nemotron-3-nano-30b`                    | 131K    | fastest in the tier (~121 tok/s)                                                                                             |
| 3             | `free/laguna-xs-2.1`                          | 131K    | coding, ~161 tok/s — on our own NVIDIA key                                                                                   |
| 4             | `free/north-mini-code`                        | 256K    | coding, 607ms median — OpenRouter's $0 pool                                                                                  |
| 5             | `free/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning` | 256K    | the only vision-capable free model                                                                                           |
| 6             | `free/nemotron-3-ultra-550b`                  | 1M      | largest free model listed, but slow and 3/15 calls return an upstream error object                                           |
| 7             | `free/llama-3.2-11b-vision`                   | 128K    | the only free Llama NVIDIA still serves; slowest, so last                                                                    |

Rungs 3 and 4 are adjacent on purpose: they run on **different capacity pools**, so one provider's outage cannot take both coding rungs.

**The free tier is no longer NVIDIA-only.** Two of the seven are hosted under their own maker's namespace upstream, which the blanket `free/X → nvidia/X` rewrite could not express — `free/north-mini-code` would have become `nvidia/north-mini-code` and 400'd on every request, quietly, because a failing rung just falls through to the next one. `toUpstreamModelId()` now consults `FREE_UPSTREAM_OVERRIDES` first, and `src/proxy.free-upstream-ids.test.ts` pins both entries.

The four dead ids keep their catalog entries so pins stay routable (the gateway redirects them); they are gone from the picker, the cascade and every generic alias. `llama-free` points at a real free Llama again. `mistral-free` no longer advertises a Mistral — there is no free one left anywhere, which is what blockrun's own `/free-mistral` page now says.

### Fixed — an uncatalogued routing target was bypassing `maxCostPerRun`

router-core V3.5 made `zai/glm-5.3-flash` the eco **MEDIUM and COMPLEX primary**, but neither it nor `zai/glm-5.3` existed in `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`. `estimateAmount()` returns `undefined` for an id we do not carry, and both consumers fail open — the budget filter keeps the model (`if (!est) return true`) and the success path skips accounting (`if (costEst)`). So every eco user with a cost cap set had **no cap on their primary model, and its spend never entered the session total**. Same shape as the v0.12.232 `max_completion_tokens` bug: a telemetry-looking gap that is actually a money bug.

Both models are added with blockrun's pricing, and `src/router/chain-models-in-catalog.test.ts` now fails the build if any model router-core can pick is one this repo cannot price.

### Fixed — 36 stale context/output envelopes

Prices were already correct; the envelopes had drifted across three blockrun releases. The ones that were truncating real requests: `claude-sonnet-4.6` 200K → **1M** context (and 64K → 128K output), `gpt-5.4`/`-pro` 400K → 1.05M, the four `grok-4*-fast` SKUs 131K → 2M, `deepseek-chat`/`-reasoner` 8192 → 65536 output, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` 8192 → 65536. Every `gemini-*` context normalised to the real 1048576.

### Changed — bare `glm` promoted 5.2 → 5.3

Same rule as `opus` 4.8 → 5: the cost tradeoff is zero — identical $1.40/$4.40 and an identical 1M / 131072 envelope — so nothing can bill or truncate differently for a caller who never typed a version, and blockrun's own copy already names 5.3 the Z.AI flagship. `glm-5.2` and every other version pin still resolve to their own model.

### Changed

- `@blockrun/router-core` pinned to `5ee7c23`: eco SIMPLE opens on `nemotron-3.5-lightning` with `nemotron-3-nano-30b` behind it, three free backstop rungs retargeted, `model-capabilities.ts` regenerated from the live catalog.
- Published counts: 73 chat models, 7 free (was 71 / 5); 253 aliases (was 229).
- `docs/9-free-ai-models-zero-cost-blockrun.md` rebuilt — every model it named was dead. The slug is kept so existing links do not break.
- The capacity-filter test fixture moved off `openai/gpt-5.3`, whose output cap rose to 128K in this resync and quietly stopped exercising the filter.

---

## v0.12.257 — August 31, 2026

### Added — counterparty policy: control _who_ the agent may pay, not just how much

`SpendLimits` already bounded how much an agent could spend per request, hour, day and session. It said nothing about **whom** it paid, or on which network and asset. Four optional, default-off lists close that: `allowedPayees`, `blockedPayees`, `allowedNetworks` and `allowedAssets`, with a block always beating an allow when an address is on both.

Enforcement runs on the live payment path, not just in the SDK: `startProxy` registers an x402 `onBeforePaymentCreation` hook, so a refusal aborts **before** the scheme signer runs and no authorization is ever produced. A configured list with no matching value on the payment refuses rather than skipping the check. Networks are CAIP-2 only — `base` does not match `eip155:8453` and fails closed. EVM addresses are compared case-insensitively so checksummed and lowercase forms both match. State lives in `~/.openclaw/blockrun/spending.json`, documented in `docs/configuration.md`.

A policy denial reaches the caller as HTTP 403 `spend_policy_denied` and is deliberately never retried against other models: it is a decision, not an outage. Treated as a retryable provider error it would have walked the entire paid fallback chain and then answered 200 from a free model, hiding the refusal completely.

Four things found in review and fixed before merge, all on the money path:

- **Amount quotes are validated, not coerced.** `Number.parseInt(amount, 10)` truncates at the first non-decimal character while `@x402/evm` signs `BigInt(value)`, and `@x402/core` validates the field as a non-empty string with no digit check. `parseInt("0x1DCD6500", 10)` is `0`; `BigInt("0x1DCD6500")` is `500000000`. A gateway quoting hex (or `0b`/`0o`) would have read as $0.000000 against every cap and still had the full amount authorized. Quotes must now be canonical decimal integers, and anything else refuses whenever a cap is set. x402 v1's `maxAmountRequired` is read too — v2 renamed it to `amount`, so v1 quotes had been parsing as free.
- **Reservations are released.** The pre-sign hold is now in-memory rather than a persisted spend record: settled when the payment is signed, released when the signer fails, and expired after two minutes. Previously a failed signer, a rejected pre-authorization and every fallback attempt each consumed budget permanently for money that never moved.
- **Recording a payment no longer erases policy.** History-only saves preserve the limits already on disk, writes are atomic (temp + rename), and an empty array means "not configured" instead of tripping the corruption guard. A torn write previously parsed as a failure and silently dropped configured lists — fail-open on the one file that must not do that.
- **A malformed policy file no longer takes the proxy down.** It refuses every paid request and says so loudly, while the proxy stays up so free models keep working.

`proxy.spend-policy.test.ts` pins the `startProxy` wiring itself: deleting the hook registration previously left the whole suite green, shipping a policy that governed nothing.

Not covered, and documented as such: Polymarket funding and order placement, and `clawrouter doctor`'s probe, sign with the same wallet outside the proxy's x402 client. There is also no CLI command for `setPolicy` yet — edit `spending.json` and restart.

- Thanks to @twzrd-sol for the design, the implementation, and two rounds of fast iteration (#268, closes #230).

## v0.12.256 — August 30, 2026

### Fixed — multimodal retries now dedupe and cache-hit like text-only ones

Timestamp stripping in the dedup and response-cache key functions only handled plain-string message `content`. For Anthropic-style array content (`[{type: "text", text}, {type: "image_url", …}]` — vision/multimodal messages), the OpenClaw-injected `[DAY YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ]` prefix lives in the leading text block, so it stayed in the hash input: a retried multimodal request (timeout, network blip) never matched its original — the same request could be **paid twice** past the dedup window's protection, and every retry re-hit the upstream LLM instead of the response cache.

Both key functions now strip the injected timestamp from array content — scoped to the **first** text block only, where OpenClaw actually injects. Later text blocks are user data (a pasted log line can legitimately start with a bracketed timestamp), and stripping those would have collided genuinely different requests onto one key — serving the wrong cached response for up to 10 minutes or wrongly deduping a distinct paid request. The shared logic (pattern + block stripper) moved to `src/timestamp-strip.ts` so dedup and cache normalization can't drift apart. Covered by the new `src/dedup.test.ts` and extended `src/response-cache.test.ts`, including regression tests pinning that non-leading text blocks are left untouched.

- Thanks to @ygd58 for finding the gap, the isolated repro, and the core fix (#273) — the first-text-block scoping and shared helper were added in review.

---

## v0.12.255 — August 30, 2026

### Fixed — img2img no longer misreports a client cancel as "Invalid request"

The `/v1/images/image2image` parse path downloads source/mask URLs with the client-abort signal (v0.12.252), so a caller hanging up mid-download rejects that fetch with an `AbortError` — which the parse catch then misclassified as invalid input and answered with a 400 on the dead socket. The catch now returns silently when `clientAbort.signal.aborted` is set, and the paid upstream is never contacted. Covered by a new case in `src/proxy.img2img-abort.test.ts` (download socket observes the abort, no response is written, zero upstream hits). Closes #277.

Also landed the remainder of PR #276 (same lineage): the three post-payment result-asset downloads — generations and img2img result images, video clips — now carry `clientAbort.signal` so a hung download is cancelled when the client leaves instead of running to the 5-minute fetch ceiling, and the chat-path `/imagegen` outer catch gained the same silent-return abort guard its `/img2img` sibling got in v0.12.253.

- Thanks to @Sertug17 for both fixes (#276, #278) — rebased onto main, where the bulk of each had already landed in v0.12.252–253.

---

## v0.12.254 — August 30, 2026

### Fixed — the chat path now cancels its paid upstream when the client disconnects

The media handlers all abort their upstream on client disconnect (#251, v0.12.252–253), but the main `/v1/chat/completions` path — the highest-traffic one — never did. `proxyRequest` wired its abort to `req.on("close")`, and on Node (verified on v24.15.0) an `IncomingMessage` emits `"close"` when the request-body readable finishes, not when the client hangs up. The body is fully drained near the top of `proxyRequest`, so that event had already passed by the time the listener was attached far below — `onClientClose` never ran, the `globalController` was only ever aborted by the request timeout, and a caller that hung up mid-request left the paid x402 upstream running to completion for a response nobody would receive. The abort now hangs off `res.on("close")` (guarded by `!res.writableEnded`), exactly like every media handler. Covered by `src/proxy.chat-abort.test.ts` (upstream socket observes the abort after the client destroys its request).

Two follow-ups landed in review on top of the contributed fix:

- **Disconnects in the pre-attach window are caught too.** Several awaits (context compression, the up-to-2.5s balance check) run between draining the body and attaching the listener; a client that hung up in that window had already emitted `"close"`, so the listener alone would never fire. `proxyRequest` now also checks `res.destroyed` right after attaching and aborts immediately.
- **A client cancel is no longer reported as a 300s timeout.** Once the abort path was live, every disconnect surfaced through the shared abort exits as `Request timed out after 300000ms` — hitting `onError`, printing a phantom timeout in the CLI, and invalidating the balance cache (an extra RPC read on the next request). The proxy now tells the two apart (`ClientDisconnectedError`), logs `Request cancelled — client disconnected`, and returns quietly. The regression test also asserts `onError` stays silent, and gates its disconnect on the upstream actually being reached instead of a fixed 500ms timer.

- Thanks to @erhnysr for the diagnosis, fix and regression test (#279).

---

## v0.12.253 — August 29, 2026

### Fixed — the last two paid handlers without a client-abort signal

v0.12.252 fixed `/v1/images/image2image` charging the wallet after the caller disconnected (#251). Two more handlers had the same shape and were closed out here: `/v1/audio/generations`, and the chat-side `/img2img` command that reaches the same image2image endpoint. Both now create an `AbortController` on the response's `close` event and thread its signal through the paid upstream call (and, for audio, the post-generation track download), and swallow the resulting abort instead of logging a bogus 502. Every paid x402 handler in the proxy now carries this wiring. Covered by `src/proxy.audio-abort.test.ts`.

---

## v0.12.252 — August 29, 2026

Two proxy fixes from community bug reports. Thanks to @Sertug17 for both (#251, #252).

### Fixed — message truncation no longer splits a tool call from its results (#252)

BlockRun caps a request at 200 messages, and `truncateMessages()` enforced that with a raw `slice(-N)` over the non-system turns. When the cut landed between an assistant `tool_calls` turn and the `role: "tool"` results that answer it, the request went upstream with orphaned results and the provider rejected it — Anthropic with `tool_use block without matching tool_result`, OpenAI with `tool_calls referenced but tool response missing`. A long agentic session would start 400ing exactly as it crossed the limit, at the point it had the most state to lose.

The boundary now walks **forward** past any leading tool results (OpenAI `role: "tool"`, and Anthropic-style `tool_result` content blocks in a `user` turn), so a straddled exchange is dropped whole instead of half-kept. Walking forward rather than back keeps the result under the 200 cap in every case, including a parallel tool call with several contiguous results. Covered by `src/proxy.truncate-tool-pairs.test.ts` (boundary on a single result, mid-parallel-exchange, tool-heavy windows, system-message preservation).

### Fixed — `/v1/images/image2image` cancels upstream when the client disconnects (#251)

`/v1/images/generations` already carried a `clientAbort` controller so a caller that hung up mid-request stopped the upstream call before the x402 payment could settle. The img2img handler never got the same wiring: the upstream request ran to completion and the wallet was charged for an image nobody received. The handler now creates the controller before reading the body and threads its signal through both the source-image URL download and the paid upstream call; an abort is swallowed instead of logged as a 502. Covered by `src/proxy.img2img-abort.test.ts` (upstream socket observes the abort after the client destroys its request).

---

## v0.12.251 — August 29, 2026

Repins the routing engine to Router Core **V3.5** (`@blockrun/router-core` @ `5d91187`). No ClawRouter code changed; the decision path did.

### Changed — every chain names a model you can see on blockrun.ai/models

V3.4's chains still leaned on ids the gateway had withheld from `/v1/models`: `moonshot/kimi-k2.7` was the MEDIUM primary in the auto, premium-SIMPLE and agentic sets, `xai/grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` opened both REASONING tiers, and the grok-4-fast pair closed half the fallback chains. V3.5 removes every hidden id from every rung and admits the current generation the catalog already sells — GPT-5.6 Terra/Luna, Gemini 3.6 Flash and 3.5 Flash-Lite, GLM-5.3 and 5.3-Flash, Grok 4.3, Kimi K3, Qwen 3.7 Plus, MiniMax M3 — as fallback rungs. Primaries moved only where router-core carries calibration evidence for the successor:

| Tier / profile              | V3.4                           | V3.5                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| AUTO MEDIUM                 | `moonshot/kimi-k2.7`           | `google/gemini-3.5-flash`    |
| AUTO / ECO REASONING        | `xai/grok-4-1-fast-reasoning`  | `deepseek/deepseek-reasoner` |
| ECO MEDIUM / COMPLEX        | `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite` | `zai/glm-5.3-flash`          |
| PREMIUM SIMPLE              | `moonshot/kimi-k2.7`           | `google/gemini-3.5-flash`    |
| PREMIUM REASONING           | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`  | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`  |
| AGENTIC MEDIUM              | `moonshot/kimi-k2.7`           | `openai/gpt-5-mini`          |
| AGENTIC COMPLEX / REASONING | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`  | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`  |

The capability snapshot behind the hard filters was regenerated from the public catalog (70 models; Haiku 4.5 was capped at 8K output and Sonnet 4.6 at 200K context) and the speed/reliability priors from a fresh 2026-08-29 gateway probe (66 models). `README.md`, `docs/routing-profiles.md`, `docs/configuration.md` and `docs/architecture.md` now describe the V3.5 chains; `brand-numbers.test.ts` pins the README tier table to the pinned config, as before.

The `kimi` / `kimi-k2.7` aliases and `/model` pins are untouched — the gateway still serves those ids by direct name; only automatic routing stops choosing them.

---

## v0.12.250 — August 29, 2026

Realigns every routing surface — code and docs — to Router Core V3.4 (`@blockrun/router-core` @ `d7bc10c`, already the pinned engine since v0.12.242) and the current model catalog.

### Fixed — `/model free` was pinned to a model that has been dead upstream for two weeks

`free` resolved to `free/gpt-oss-120b`. That model stopped completing on 2026-08-16 (NVIDIA still lists it; a completion hangs until the client gives up — blockrun #391 retargeted its whole free cascade off it the same day) and the gateway now answers `400 Unknown model` for the `free/` id. Every `/model free` call, the budget-cap free fallback (`FREE_MODEL`) and the head of the proxy's `FREE_MODELS` cascade all opened on it, and the picker label still promised "GPT-OSS 120B".

All three now agree on **`free/step-3.7-flash`** — the same model router-core opens the eco SIMPLE tier on, live-probed 200 through the gateway. The cascade is now step-3.7-flash → nemotron-nano-9b-v2 → mistral-nemotron → nemotron-omni (vision) → nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl (vision), mirroring router-core's free rungs; gpt-oss-120b/20b are dropped from it (dead, and hidden from the public catalog over NVIDIA's prompt-retention terms since 2026-04-28). Generic shorthands that had been parked on gpt-oss-120b (`nvidia`, `coder-free`, `qwen-coder`, `qwen-thinking`, `devstral`, `nemotron-ultra/-super/-49b/-120b/-253b`) follow the free default; pins that _name_ gpt-oss (`gpt-120b`, `gpt-oss-120b`, `nvidia/gpt-oss-120b`) stay routable and rely on the gateway redirect, as before.

Invariant, now written down at all three sites: the `free` alias, `FREE_MODELS[0]` and router-core's `ecoTiers.SIMPLE.primary` must be one live model. `src/router/free-model-liveness.test.ts` already guards the router side; the alias/label tests in `models.test.ts` and `exclude-models.test.ts` were repointed.

### Changed — routing docs describe the router that actually ships

Since v0.12.242 the README, `docs/routing-profiles.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/architecture.md` and the OpenClaw skill still described the pre-extraction rules router: "Weighted Scorer → Tier → Best Model", a tier table with `kimi-k2.6` and `free/gpt-oss-120b`, a `src/router/config.ts` that no longer exists, a "Default Tier Mappings" table (`deepseek-chat` as MEDIUM primary, `o3-mini` for REASONING) that never matched any shipped config, an `agenticTask` weight of 0.10 (it is 0.04), a `reasoningConfidence` knob that does not exist, and a claim that ambiguous queries "hit the LLM classifier" — nothing in the proxy calls one. The README's Routing Profiles table had also been corrupted by a footnote spliced into the `auto` row.

Rewritten against router-core's config and README:

- **README** — "How It Works" now walks the four constraint-first stages (classify → hard filters → rank → recovery chain), the tier table gains the AGENTIC column with its ‡ footnote, the profiles table is repaired, and the V3.4 three-arm benchmark numbers (57% vs 49% task success, −6.4% cost per successful task, 8.9% of a pinned flagship's tokens) are cited with the caveat that they come from a frozen agent benchmark. `kimi-k3` moved out of the "Budget" table (it is $3/$15). The "1M-context DeepSeek V4 Flash" free-tier bullet — EOL'd 2026-08-12 — is gone.
- **docs/routing-profiles.md** — full chains for AUTO / ECO / PREMIUM / AGENTIC straight from `DEFAULT_ROUTING_CONFIG`, the per-profile ranking weights and affinity floors, the `free` alias semantics, and the `strategy: "rules"` / `shadow` levers.
- **docs/configuration.md** — `routing.strategy`, `routing.shadow`, per-tier merge semantics, `ecoTiers` / `premiumTiers` / `agenticTiers: null`, the real `overrides` keys (`maxTokensForceComplex`, `structuredOutputMinTier`, `ambiguousDefaultTier`, `agenticMode`), corrected scorer weights and sigmoid parameters, and a `route()` example that shows the V3 decision shape (`taskType`, `candidates`, `candidateScores`, `routerVersion`).
- **docs/architecture.md** — Routing Engine section rewritten around router-core's four stages; file tree and key-files table no longer list `router/{rules,selector,config,types}.ts`.
- **skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md** — "How Routing Works" matches the above; the `routing` config row says what it actually overrides.

`docs/smart-llm-router-14-dimension-classifier.md` is a dated benchmark write-up and is deliberately untouched.

## v0.12.249 — August 25, 2026

### Fixed — `/health?full=true` could hang forever on an unresponsive balance RPC

The full health check awaited `balanceMonitor.checkBalance()` with no time bound. The surrounding `catch` covers a rejection but never a hang, so an unresponsive RPC held the response open indefinitely — on the one endpoint monitoring hits and the one that must always answer. The check is now bounded by the same `BALANCE_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MS` (2.5s) as the pre-request path and degrades to `balanceError`, which the response shape already carried.

This is also why CI's `lifecycle` integration test had been failing: GitHub runners are slow enough to reach the RPC that the endpoint blew past the test's 5s limit. Covered by `src/proxy.health-balance-timeout.test.ts` (hanging monitor, asserts the answer lands well inside the RPC delay).

### Fixed — live-gateway integration tests no longer gate the npm publish

There was no `vitest.config.ts`, so `npm test` fell back to vitest's default glob and swept in `test/integration/**` — seven suites that stand up a proxy and send real requests to the live BlockRun gateway. On a GitHub runner those hang past even their own declared 30s timeouts, which meant a release could be blocked by runner networking rather than by anything wrong with the code (v0.12.249 was blocked twice this way). Ironically `vitest.integration.config.ts` already existed with the right 30s/15s timeouts and was wired to nothing.

`npm test` is now hermetic (716 tests) and `npm run test:integration` runs the gateway-dependent suites (26 tests) on demand. Same 742 total; nothing dropped.

### Fixed — `prettier --check` restored to green

`docs/image-generation.md` and `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` landed unformatted in v0.12.247 (#254), leaving the Lint & Typecheck job red on every commit since. Formatting only.

---

## v0.12.248 — August 25, 2026

### Fixed — agents went silent for the whole tool-using stretch of a conversation

Any assistant turn carrying `tool_calls` had its `content` blanked to `""` before it reached the client, on both the streaming and non-streaming paths. The turn kept its tool call and lost its voice: an operator watching a long-running agent saw an unbroken run of bare `[Called function "exec" ...]` lines, and a plain question typed into the chat ("did you send it yet?") came back as another bare tool call with the answer deleted en route. Re-asking only produced more tool calls, because every reply the model wrote was discarded by the proxy rather than never written.

Three sites blanked it: the SSE synthesizer (which then skipped emitting the content chunk entirely), the non-streaming native-`tool_calls` branch, and the non-streaming branch that synthesizes tool calls out of text. The third is the sharpest case — `extractTextualToolCalls` already computes `cleanedContent`, the model's prose with the raw `<tool_call>` markup stripped out, and it is unit-tested to preserve exactly that prose; `proxy.ts` never read it.

All three now forward the prose, still running it through `stripThinkingTokens`, so tagged chain-of-thought (`<think>`, Kimi `<｜...｜>`) is stripped as before and raw tool-call syntax still never leaks into chat. This matches what OpenAI-compatible clients already expect: `content` and `tool_calls` on the same message. Set `CLAWROUTER_TOOL_CALL_PROSE=off` to restore the old suppression for models that dump untagged planning prose into `content`.

The four tests that asserted the blanking were rewritten to assert delivery; `src/proxy.tool-call-prose.test.ts` covers the native, textual, streaming, thinking-token, and opt-out paths.

---

## v0.12.247 — August 23, 2026

### Fixed — OpenClaw image picker no longer advertises delisted models (#254)

`buildImageGenerationProvider()` still advertised `openai/dall-e-3` (delisted upstream 2026-05-25) and `black-forest/flux-1.1-pro` (no gateway entry) — both dropped from `IMAGE_PRICING` in v0.12.227 but missed in the picker, where a pick is forwarded to `/v1/images/generations` verbatim (no alias resolution) and 400s upstream. The inverse gap too: `gpt-image-2`, `nano-banana-2`, and `seedream-5-pro` were priced but never advertised, so unreachable from the picker. Picker resynced to the 9 servable ids, `IMAGE_MODEL_IDS` exported as the pinning source of truth, partner-registry tool description refreshed, `banana-2`/`nano-banana-2` shorthands added to `/cr-imagegen`, and a regression test pins picker ↔ `IMAGE_PRICING` in both directions. Live-verified 2026-08-23: the gateway rejects both dead ids pre-payment (`400 Unknown image model`) and quotes all 9 advertised ones.

- Thanks to @memosr for #254 (including the follow-up alias + help fixes from review).

### Fixed — `/cr-imagegen` now completes slow-model (202) jobs

The chat-prefix imagegen path treated a `202 + poll_url` response as success with empty `data` (`Response.ok` is true for 202), so any model exceeding the gateway's 30s inline window — `gpt-image-2` is the canonical case — surfaced as "Image generation returned no results" with the job abandoned. The path now polls the job like the `/v1/images/generations` handler does (3s interval, 5min budget, client-abort guard so a disconnected chat client stops the poll loop before it settles the payment). The upload-failure hint no longer steers users toward a specific model.

### Fixed — advertised image sizes live-verified against the gateway

The gateway validates `size` **per model before payment** and rejects unknown ones. The picker's global size list still carried `1216x832`, `1792x1024`, and `1024x1792` — accepted by no current model (the latter two were dall-e-3's native sizes) — and was missing six sizes Seedream 5 Pro actually serves. `geometry.sizes` is now exactly the live-probed union (16 sizes), pinned by test against the new `IMAGE_MODEL_SIZES` export; Seedream's `IMAGE_PRICING` size map filled in from 402 quotes (`1280x720`/`2048x1024` at $0.045, the 2K portrait/landscape tiers at $0.09).

### Changed — image-catalog drift-proofing

- `IMAGE_MODEL_ALIASES` hoisted to module scope and exported; tests now pin every alias target to a servable id and the partner-registry description to the exact catalog + count. A prototype-key lookup (`--model constructor`) can no longer resolve to a function and send a model-less body upstream.
- Doc surfaces resynced: `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` (8 → 9 image models, Nano Banana 2 listed), `skills/imagegen/SKILL.md` (banana-2 row; removed recommended sizes that 400 — e.g. nano-banana `1216x832`, banana-pro `1024x1792`), README `banana-2` row, `docs/image-generation.md` (still documented dall-e-3/flux as live and mapped `dall-e-3` → `openai/dall-e-3`; full 9-model refresh with per-model size lists), `scripts/reinstall.sh` example.

---

## v0.12.246 — August 22, 2026

### Changed — new installs default to the Solana payment chain

Brand-new wallets now persist `payment-chain = solana` at generation time (`generateAndSaveWallet` in `src/auth.ts`), so first-run users start on the Solana gateway (`sol.blockrun.ai`). **Existing installs are completely unaffected** — the `loadPaymentChain()` fallback for an absent `~/.openclaw/blockrun/payment-chain` file stays `base`, which is where pre-existing wallets hold their USDC.

- The default is written **only when Solana address derivation succeeds** (it dynamically imports `@solana/kit`, which plugin installers sometimes drop — see the reinstall workaround in `scripts/update.sh`). If derivation fails, the write is skipped and the user stays on the Base fallback rather than being defaulted onto a chain the proxy can't sign for.
- Recovery/import flows deliberately do NOT change the chain: `BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY` env restore, `wallet recover`, and the legacy `setupSolana` opt-in path all bypass wallet generation, so a restored wallet keeps resolving to wherever its funds already live.
- `CLAWROUTER_PAYMENT_CHAIN` still overrides the persisted selection in both directions; `/wallet base` switches a new install back at any time.
- New wallet banner now states the Solana default and how to switch back.
- Tests: `src/auth.payment-chain-default.test.ts` (fresh generate → solana; saved/env/explicit-base paths untouched; env override wins) + `src/auth.payment-chain-default-failure.test.ts` (derivation-failure guard), and `test/smoke-wallet-scenarios.ts` now asserts the chain file on real disk.
- Docs: removed the `/chain` command from README and `docs/configuration.md` — it was never a registered slash command (use `/wallet solana` / `/wallet base`); documented the new-install default in README, `docs/configuration.md`, and `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md`.

---

## v0.12.245 — August 12, 2026

Catch-up sync to blockrun: one free-model EOL (today's), ten model additions that had never been mirrored, and six stale prices. Catalog is now 70 chat-visible / 5 free, matching blockrun exactly.

### Removed — `free/deepseek-v4-flash` is dead upstream (blockrun #367)

NVIDIA published EOL for the whole `nvidia/deepseek-*` family: HTTP 410 ("has reached its end of life") on both of blockrun's live probe passes this morning, prod gate fired `[ALERT][free-model-dead] kind=gone` twice. It was the last free DeepSeek — and the last 1M-context free model.

- Dropped from the picker (`top-models.json`, 6 → 5 free — again exactly blockrun's visible free set), the `FREE_MODELS` auto-pick cascade (8 → 7), and router-core's eco SIMPLE chain ([`18bf4ab`](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/router-core/commit/18bf4ab), pin bumped). Same `/exclude`-defeating failure mode as seed-oss-36b in v0.12.241, same fix.
- Pins naming the model itself (`deepseek-v4-flash`, `v4-flash`, `nvidia/deepseek-v4-flash`) stay routable — the gateway redirects them to gpt-oss-120b. Generic shorthands (`deepseek-free`, `v4-pro`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, and the `deepseek-v3.2` ids whose redirects chained through flash) follow blockrun's own retarget to `free/gpt-oss-120b` instead of chaining through a dead model.
- Note bare `deepseek` still resolves to the **paid** `deepseek/deepseek-chat`, as before — no free alias was silently moved onto a paid SKU.

### Added — ten models blockrun shipped that ClawRouter never mirrored

Seven chat (blockrun #329, 2026-08-03), two chat from 2026-07-25, one image, one video:

- **toolCalling LIVE-VERIFIED** on all seven new chat models that carry the flag: qwen3.7-plus, qwen3.7-flash, hy3, mimo-v2.5-pro, gemini-3.6-flash, gemini-3.5-flash-lite, and gpt-5.6-luna-pro each returned a structured `tool_calls` array (name + valid JSON args, `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`) through the live gateway (~$0.003/probe, the qwen3.7-max pattern).
- Generic aliases untouched: `gpt5`/`gpt-5.6` stay on standard Terra, bare `qwen` stays unbound, bare `nano-banana` and `seedance` stay on their cheaper originals. New pins: `sol-pro`/`terra-pro`/`luna-pro` (+ full forms), `qwen3.7-plus`/`-flash`, `hy3`/`tencent`/`hunyuan`, `mimo`/`xiaomi`, `gemini-3.6-flash`, `banana-2`, `seedance-2-mini`.

### Fixed — six stale prices (telemetry + cost-cap accounting)

| model                        | was          | now              | source                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `openai/gpt-5.6-terra`       | 2.50 / 15.00 | **2.00 / 12.00** | OpenAI's 2026-07-30 cut (blockrun #326)            |
| `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`        | 1.00 / 6.00  | **0.20 / 1.20**  | same                                               |
| `deepseek/deepseek-chat`     | 0.20 / 0.40  | **0.14 / 0.28**  | blockrun #354 (old rate was 1.43× real)            |
| `deepseek/deepseek-reasoner` | 0.20 / 0.40  | **0.14 / 0.28**  | same                                               |
| `zai/glm-5`                  | 0.60 / 1.92  | **1.00 / 3.20**  | blockrun #354                                      |
| `google/gemini-3.5-flash`    | 0.50 / 3.00  | **1.50 / 9.00**  | blockrun #304 (was billed at 1/3 of Google's rate) |

Charges are server-dictated via 402 as always, but these numbers feed `logUsage` and the strict-mode `maxCostPerRun` gate, so the two-month-stale gemini-3.5-flash row was letting capped wallets underestimate by 3×. README pricing tables re-tiered to match (luna drops to the budget table, glm-5 and gemini-3.5-flash move up to mid-range).

### Changed — brand numbers 71 → 70 chat, 6 → 5 free; aliases 204 → 229

Markers refreshed from blockrun's live catalog, plus the two plain-text surfaces the markers can't reach (`package.json` description, SKILL.md frontmatter). The alias count moves in blockrun's `src/lib/brand-numbers.ts` via [blockrun #371](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/blockrun/pull/371) — the local snapshot leads prod until that merges.

---

## v0.12.244 — August 8, 2026

Syncs the Seedance video family to blockrun, which added a fourth model and repriced the other three.

### Added — `bytedance/seedance-2.5`

- 720p with synced audio, long-form (up to 30s vs the 12–15s ceiling on the rest of the family), multilingual, image-to-video capable. For 1080p or 4K, Seedance 2.0 Pro is still the one.
- Reachable as `seedance-2.5` or `seedance-2-5`, and listed in `/videogen`.
- **Bare `seedance` deliberately stays on 1.5-pro.** It is the cheapest of the family ($0.070/s vs 2.5's $0.315/s) and `/videogen` documents it as "default — cheapest"; repointing the short name at the newest tier would 4.5× the quote for everyone who typed it expecting the default. Same rule that keeps `kimi` on K2.7.
- Note: 2.5 has no OpenRouter failover upstream, so a token360 outage surfaces as an error rather than quietly rendering on a different model.

### Fixed — all three existing Seedance rates were stale

blockrun repriced the family (blockrun #351/#354) and ClawRouter was still carrying the old numbers:

| model               | was     | now       |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| `seedance-1.5-pro`  | 0.0875  | **0.070** |
| `seedance-2.0-fast` | 0.22687 | **0.165** |
| `seedance-2.0`      | 0.28358 | **0.227** |

These are base rates; `estimateVideoCost` applies the 5% margin at use. **Telemetry only** — the charge comes from the x402 payment header, and this estimate is the fallback for when `paymentStore` is empty. So the impact was a skewed usage log, never a wrong bill.

### Changed — published alias count 202 → 204

The two new pins move the total, and `src/router/brand-numbers.test.ts` pins it against blockrun's artifact. That number is hand-maintained in blockrun (`src/lib/brand-numbers.ts`) because the alias table lives here and cannot be counted from there. Updated on both sides; the guard is what caught it.

---

## v0.12.243 — August 8, 2026

Clears the last **high**-severity dependency alert. `npm audit` on this repo goes from 4 high / 17 low to **0 high / 17 low**.

### Security — `bigint-buffer` is out of the tree

- `bigint-buffer`'s native `toBigIntLE()` carries an unpatched buffer overflow ([GHSA-3gc7-fjrx-p6mg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3gc7-fjrx-p6mg)). There is no fixed release anywhere: 1.1.5 is the last publish, from 2019, and `@trufflesuite/bigint-buffer@1.1.10` ships a **byte-identical** `src/bigint-buffer.c`, so overriding onto the fork would launder the advisory without fixing anything.
- It reached us four levels down: `@blockrun/llm` → `@solana/spl-token` → `@solana/buffer-layout-utils` → `bigint-buffer`. ClawRouter never executes that path — it imports the EVM `createPaymentPayload`, not `createSolanaPaymentPayload`, and Solana payments go through `@x402/svm`. The package still landed in every consumer's lockfile because `@solana/spl-token` was an **optional dependency** of `@blockrun/llm`, and npm installs those automatically.
- Fixed upstream in [`@blockrun/llm@3.10.0`](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/blockrun-llm-ts/releases/tag/v3.10.0): the Solana packages are now optional **peer** dependencies, which npm does _not_ auto-install. Consumers who make Solana payments through that SDK install `@solana/web3.js` and `@solana/spl-token` explicitly and get an actionable error if they forget.
- ClawRouter's floor moves to `@blockrun/llm@^3.10.0` and the lockfile is regenerated. Verified: `npm ls bigint-buffer` returns empty, and `dist/` still contains zero references to `spl-token`, `buffer-layout-utils`, or `toBigIntLE`.
- **Trap worth remembering:** bumping the dependency alone did not drop it. `npm install @blockrun/llm@^3.10.0` updated the SDK but kept the stale transitive entry — the optional-dependency-to-optional-peer change only takes effect after a full `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json` regeneration. Same class as the override staleness in v0.12.240.
- `@solana/kit` re-verified at **5.5.1** after the regeneration (the v5-vs-v6 split is what broke Solana signing back in March).

Remaining: 17 low from the `elliptic` chain under `@polymarket/*` (ethers v5). 6.6.1 is the latest release and is still in the advisory's range, so there is nothing to move to.

## v0.12.242 — August 7, 2026

Makes the deterministic **Router v3.4 portfolio strategy the default for Auto**, and moves the routing engine out of this repo into [`BlockRunAI/router-core`](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/router-core).

Thanks to @KillerQueen-Z for the router work and the extraction (#238).

### Changed — portfolio routing is the Auto default

- Auto now classifies task shape locally, enforces tool / vision / structured-output / context constraints as hard filters, then ranks an ordered fallback portfolio. The previous path picked a fixed tier primary after rule classification. On a frozen 100-task, three-arm evaluation the new policy scored 57% vs 49% and cut normalized cost per successful task by 6.44%.
- Routing stays **100% local and deterministic** — no extra model call, no network hop. Model capabilities are injected from ClawRouter's live catalog at proxy startup, so the product catalog remains authoritative.
- `tool_choice: "none"` is authoritative, and host tool descriptions no longer create false per-turn tool requirements.
- Rollback lever: set `routing.strategy = "rules"`. An optional local-only shadow mode compares the two strategies' metadata without issuing a second paid completion or persisting any prompt.

### Changed — routing engine extracted to router-core

- `src/router/{config,rules,selector,strategy,types}.ts` are gone; `src/router/index.ts` re-exports `@blockrun/router-core`, pinned to immutable commit `6a790eb`. `@blockrun/clawrouter/router` stays available as a subpath export for existing SDK consumers.
- The dependency is **`devDependencies`, deliberately**: tsup's `noExternal` inlines it into `dist/`, so nothing imports it at runtime. Keeping it in `dependencies` would make every `npm install @blockrun/clawrouter` fetch a `codeload.github.com` tarball at install time — resolved from a bare URL with no lockfile-backed integrity, since the published package doesn't ship our lockfile, and broken whenever GitHub is unreachable. The packed tarball still declares zero non-registry dependencies.

### Fixed — a stale build put the retired seed-oss-36b back in three fallback chains

- `dist/router/index.js` shipped `free/seed-oss-36b` in three fallback chains even though router-core's pinned commit had already removed it. The committed artifact had been built against a pre-fix install. Rebuilt.
- This is the same class of bug as v0.12.241: BlockRun **server-redirects** retired free ids, so routing to one **silently defeats `/exclude`** — the caller excludes a model, the router hands it the request anyway, and the gateway answers from the redirect target.
- **A correct commit pin does not imply a correct committed `dist/`.** This repo ships `dist/`, so both have to be checked.

### Added — free-model liveness guard

- `src/router/free-model-liveness.test.ts` walks every tier container's `primary` and `fallback` entries and asserts each `free/*` id is still live. The allowed set is **derived from `src/top-models.json`** (plus the two deliberate `gpt-oss` defaults), so a future free-tier resync updates the guard automatically — models should never be added to it by hand.
- It exists because router selection coverage left this repo along with the code (`selector.test.ts` and `strategy.test.ts` deleted, none added), and the stale-build regression above walked straight through the gap. Verified to fail against that exact regression, and it fails loudly rather than vacuously if the upstream config shape changes.

---

## v0.12.241 — August 7, 2026

Finishes the free-tier resync that #232 started. That commit refreshed the **brand markers** to blockrun's live catalog (71 chat-visible / 6 free) but touched no code, so the router kept routing to a model that has been dead upstream since 2026-08-03.

### Fixed — `free/seed-oss-36b` is EOL and was still in the auto-pick cascade

- blockrun's probe got **HTTP 410 Gone** from NVIDIA on both passes (2026-08-03) and the production health gate fired `[ALERT][free-model-dead] kind=gone` the same day. Upstream hid the model and re-pointed its own dependents — `qwen3-coder-480b` and `devstral-2-123b`, which both used seed-oss as their fallback — at `gpt-oss-120b`.
- ClawRouter was still carrying it in three places that matter at request time:
  - the **`FREE_MODELS` auto-pick cascade** (`proxy.ts`) — 9 entries → **8**,
  - the **picker** (`src/top-models.json`) — 7 free → **6**, now exactly blockrun's visible free set,
  - **three router fallback chains** (`router/config.ts`).
- This is not cosmetic. A dead model that the gateway server-redirects **silently defeats `/exclude`**: a caller excludes it, the router hands the request to it anyway, and the gateway answers from the redirect target. Same failure mode as `mistral-large-3-675b` in v0.12.239 — same fix.
- The `free` profile's SIMPLE chain drops the rung outright (`gpt-oss-120b`/`20b` already head it). The premium and agentic "NVIDIA free ultimate backstop" rungs are **retargeted** to `free/gpt-oss-120b` rather than dropped, since nothing else free sat below them.

### Changed — generic coding aliases follow the gateway, pins stay routable

Six shorthands promised "a live free coder" and pointed at a dead one. They now resolve to `free/gpt-oss-120b`, matching blockrun's own retarget: `qwen-coder`, `qwen-coder-free`, `coder-free`, `glm-free`, `devstral`, `devstral-2`.

Unchanged and still routable, because they name the model itself rather than a capability: `seed-oss`, `seed-oss-36b`, `nvidia/seed-oss-36b`, and the catalog entry. The gateway redirects them, exactly as it does for the other retired free ids.

---

## v0.12.240 — August 4, 2026

Security housekeeping. Clears **13 of the 15 open Dependabot alerts** — including 3 of the 4 highs — by removing the thing that was silently swallowing our `overrides` block.

### Fixed — openclaw's `npm-shrinkwrap.json` was voiding every override we wrote

- `openclaw` ≤ 2026.7.1 publishes with `hasShrinkwrap: true`. A shipped `npm-shrinkwrap.json` pins that package's **entire subtree** verbatim, and npm resolves it ahead of the root project's `overrides`. The failure is silent and actively misleading: `npm ls` prints `fast-uri@3.1.2 overridden` next to a version the override forbids.
- So v0.12.239's `fast-uri`/`hono`/`brace-expansion` overrides — and the pre-existing ones — **never took effect** on anything under `node_modules/openclaw/`. Deleting `package-lock.json` and reinstalling from scratch did not help either; only the shrinkwrap going away does.
- Bumped the `openclaw` dev dependency to **`^2026.7.2-beta.7`**, the first release that ships without the shrinkwrap. With it gone the overrides land, and the openclaw subtree audits clean:

  | package             | before  | after  |
  | ------------------- | ------- | ------ |
  | `undici`            | 8.5.0   | 8.10.0 |
  | `fast-uri`          | 3.1.2   | 3.1.5  |
  | `hono`              | 4.12.25 | 4.13.0 |
  | `@hono/node-server` | 1.19.14 | 2.1.0  |
  | `ip-address`        | 10.2.0  | 10.4.0 |
  | `brace-expansion`   | 5.0.7   | 5.0.9  |

- Overrides for `@hono/node-server` and `ip-address` are new; `ws`, `postcss`, `tar`, `brace-expansion`, and `fast-uri` floors were raised. All still inside the **single** `overrides` key (see v0.12.238's gotcha).
- The `openclaw` scanner integration test still runs against the real scanner chunk on the new version — it throws rather than skipping when the chunk cannot be loaded, so a silent pass is not possible.

### Changed — contributor Node floor is now 22.22.3

- openclaw 2026.7.2's preinstall gate rejects Node below `22.22.3`, so `npm install` in this repo now requires it. CI's `node-version: "22"` already resolves above the floor.
- **Published users are unaffected**: `openclaw` is a dev dependency and an optional peer, and is never bundled into `dist/`. The package's own `engines.node` stays `>=22`.

### Changed — bundled `undici` floor raised to ^8.10.0

- tsup inlines runtime deps, so this one does ship. The previously bundled 8.9.0 was already past the advisory range (`< 8.9.0`); the bump is the current patch line, not a vulnerability fix. `dist/` grows the corresponding upstream changes (TLS `servername` handling, idle-socket timeout).

### Not fixed — two alerts with no upstream patch

- **`bigint-buffer` (high, GHSA-3gc7-fjrx-p6mg).** No fixed release exists: 1.1.5 is the last publish (2019), and `@trufflesuite/bigint-buffer@1.1.10`'s `src/bigint-buffer.c` is **byte-identical** to it — the fork is not a patch, so overriding onto it would launder the alert without fixing anything. It reaches the lockfile as an optional dependency of `@blockrun/llm` (`→ @solana/spl-token → @solana/buffer-layout-utils`), pulled in only by `createSolanaPaymentPayload`, which ClawRouter never imports — we use the EVM `createPaymentPayload`. Verified absent from the shipped bundle: `dist/` contains zero references to `spl-token`, `buffer-layout-utils`, or `toBigIntLE`. The real fix belongs upstream in `@blockrun/llm`, whose Solana extras are already lazy `await import()`s and could be optional peers instead of optional dependencies.
- **`elliptic` (low, GHSA-848j-6mx2-7j84).** 6.6.1 is the latest release and is still in the vulnerable range. It arrives via ethers v5 under `@polymarket/*`.

---

## v0.12.239 — August 2, 2026

Catches up with blockrun's **2026-07-28 free-model re-probe** (blockrun #309) and the **2026-07-29 fee revert** (blockrun #319). Verified live against the gateway before syncing: `nvidia/deepseek-v4-flash` answers and stays $0; the brand artifact now publishes 65 chat models / 7 free.

### Changed — free/mistral-large-3-675b is EOL at NVIDIA (HTTP 410)

- blockrun's 07-28 re-probe got **410 Gone on both passes** for `mistral-large-3-675b` (plus `qwen3-next-80b` and `qwen3.5-397b`, which ClawRouter had already dropped on 07-17). Upstream hides it and server-redirects calls to `gpt-oss-120b`.
- Removed from the `FREE_MODELS` auto-pick cascade, the picker (`top-models.json`), and the eco SIMPLE fallback chain — a server-redirected dead model in the cascade silently defeats `/exclude`. The catalog entry and explicit pins (`mistral-large`, `mistral-large-3-675b`) stay routable; the gateway redirects them.
- `mistral-free` re-aimed at `free/mistral-nemotron`, the last live free Mistral (blockrun demoted its own `/free-mistral` primary the same way).
- `free/deepseek-v4-flash` **stays**: the same probe measured it slow on real prompts (~10 tok/s, 74.6s) but completing — and it is the only 1M-context free model. The 07-17 "3.2s recovery" was a short-ping artifact.
- Free count is now **7** across README, SKILL.md, and brand-number markers (chat-visible total: 65).

### Changed — per-transaction fee mirrored back to $0.001

- blockrun reverted the flat settlement fee from $0.002 to **$0.001/tx** on 2026-07-29 (#319). `estimateAmount()` and the README pricing note follow. Payments were always server-quoted via 402 — the old value only over-reserved balance pre-checks and overstated usage logs by $0.001/call.

### Security — dependency refresh

- `openclaw` dev dependency bumped to 2026.7.1; overrides added for `brace-expansion`, `fast-uri`, `tar`, `hono`, and `jayson > uuid` (all merged into the single existing `overrides` block — see v0.12.238's gotcha), and `package-lock.json` regenerated. tsup bundles runtime deps into `dist/`, so the override floors ship in the artifact.

---

## v0.12.238 — August 2, 2026

### Security — vulnerable axios 0.27.2 was being bundled into every install

- `@polymarket/builder-relayer-client@0.0.10` pins `axios@^0.27.2` (2022-era, 20+ open advisories including high-severity SSRF/CSRF classes). Because tsup bundles all dependencies (`noExternal`), that copy shipped inside `dist/` to every user — npm overrides in a consumer's project can't reach it. Added a root `axios: "$axios"` override so the whole tree dedupes to the current 1.x line; the relayer client's axios usage (`create`/`request`/`isAxiosError`) is 1.x-compatible, and the newer Polymarket SDKs in the same tree were already on 1.x. Verified the 0.27.2 code is gone from the built bundle.
- **Gotcha for next time:** `package.json` already had an `overrides` block further down (basic-ftp/ws/postcss/esbuild). Adding a second `overrides` key parses as valid JSON but npm silently uses only the last one — merge into the existing block.
- Remaining known-unfixable transitive: `bigint-buffer` (buffer overflow in `toBigIntLE()`, no patched release exists) via `@blockrun/llm → @solana/spl-token`. It processes our own wallet-balance buffers, not attacker-controlled input; tracked until the Solana ecosystem moves off it.

---

## v0.12.237 — August 2, 2026

### Fixed — huge default `max_tokens` no longer forces free-model fallback

- OpenClaw can send a model's default output ceiling as `max_tokens` (128k on Opus-class models). The low-balance preflight treated that as guaranteed spend, so a paid call to `anthropic/claude-opus-5` could silently fall back to a free model even with $5+ in the wallet. The preflight now caps its assumed output at 4096 tokens via `estimateBalancePreflightAmount()`; the request payload is untouched and x402 still enforces the real server quote.
- `estimateAmount()` stays exact where worst-case matters: the strict `maxCostPerRun` cap and cached-balance deduction. The free-fallback path now also clears the stale paid estimate, so a request that fell back to free no longer deducts a paid-model estimate from the cached balance.
- Thanks to @0xCheetah1 for the fix and regression suite (#217).

---

## v0.12.236 — August 2, 2026

### Fixed — `vision` missing on MiniMax M3

- `minimax/minimax-m3` was registered without `vision`, so `filterByVision()` dropped it from the candidate pool whenever a request carried an `image_url` content part. blockrun's catalog lists M3 as chat+reasoning+coding with no vision category, but that is the same upstream under-claim class as `claude-haiku-4.5`/`claude-sonnet-4.6` (see v0.12.235): a live gateway probe on 2026-08-02 sent a two-color image to M3 and it described both colors and their positions correctly. `minimax-m2.7` is text-only upstream and stays without the flag; a regression test pins both. (#226)

### Notes

- Rejected in review, not merged: a proposed switch of the music default to `minimax/music-3.0` (#227). blockrun's gateway registers only `minimax/music-2.5+` and rejects unknown audio model ids with `400`, so the new default would have failed every music request. The mock-upstream e2e suite cannot catch invalid gateway ids — it accepts any model string.

---

## v0.12.235 — July 25, 2026

Fixes capability-flag drift found by auditing all 88 shared entries against blockrun's `categories` array. What began as a single missing `vision` on `gpt-5.4-pro` turned out to be 16 mismatches; 9 are corrected here, 7 are deliberate and now pinned by tests.

### Fixed — `vision` missing on the max-compute Pro tiers

- `openai/gpt-5.2-pro` and `openai/gpt-5.4-pro` were registered without `vision`, though blockrun lists it on both. `vision` gates `filterByVision()`, so image requests were dropping both models from the candidate pool for no reason — a silent capability under-claim, not a routing preference.

### Fixed — `reasoning` missing on seven thinking-capable models

- `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`, `free/nemotron-nano-9b-v2`, `free/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl`, `zai/glm-5`, `zai/glm-5.1`, `zai/glm-5.2`, `zai/glm-5-turbo`.
- The flag enrolls an id in `REASONING_MODEL_IDS` (`proxy.ts`), raising its per-model timeout from 60s to 180s. These models genuinely think before first token, so the 60s ceiling was cutting them off early on cold start. None of the seven is a tier primary, so the longer stall is confined to fallback paths that only run after a primary already failed.

### Kept — `vision` on two Claude models blockrun under-claims

- blockrun lists `claude-haiku-4.5` as chat+coding and `claude-sonnet-4.6` as chat+coding+reasoning; neither carries `vision`. That is an **upstream catalog bug, not a ClawRouter over-claim** — a live gateway probe sent an image to `claude-haiku-4.5` and it read the image correctly.
- Dropping the flag to "match" the source of truth would have broken image routing to the premium REASONING primary and both agentic primaries. The source-of-truth rule governs pricing, ids and aliases; it is not a mandate to copy an upstream data error into a working-feature regression. Worth fixing in blockrun's catalog.

### Notes

- Also confirmed the deployed `/api/v1/models` response lags blockrun's repo on `categories` — audit against the repo, not the live endpoint.
- Three remaining `reasoning` gaps (`openai/gpt-5.3-codex`, `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, `free/gpt-oss-120b`) are **intentionally left alone**: all three are tier primaries, so the flag would triple the failover stall on default routing paths. Changing them is a latency decision, not a data fix.
- `xai/grok-4.20-*` are hidden upstream and left untouched.
- A new `capability flags vs blockrun's catalog` suite pins the resolved set so this cannot drift silently again.

---

## v0.12.234 — July 25, 2026

Closes two catalog gaps found by diffing the live gateway against `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` during the Opus 5 sync — both models were already live upstream and billable, but absent from the registry, so they carried no local pricing and never appeared in the picker.

### Added — GPT-5.5 Pro

- **`openai/gpt-5.5-pro`**: max-compute tier of the 5.5 family. $30/$180 per 1M, **1.05M context**, 128K max output, reasoning + vision. Mirrors the `gpt-5.4-pro` shape and joins it in the picker.
- Pin: **`gpt-5.5-pro`**. Deliberately **not** flagged `agentic` (same as `gpt-5.4-pro`) — max-compute latency makes it a poor multi-step autonomous pick, and the flag would pull it into agentic tier selection.
- Upstream also applies OpenAI's long-context tier (2x input / 1.5x output above 272K prompt tokens), which this registry cannot express. As with grok, that skews `logUsage` only — the charge is server-dictated via 402.

### Added — ChatGPT Instant (`chat-latest`)

- **`openai/chat-latest`**: ChatGPT's default model, tuned for speed and concision. $5/$30 per 1M, 128K context, chat + vision. Pins: **`chat-latest`**, **`chatgpt`**.
- The id is intentionally version-less. Upstream exposes ChatGPT's default _only_ as the rolling `chat-latest` alias, so pinning it means "whatever ChatGPT's default is today", not a fixed snapshot — the display name tracks the current one and needs refreshing whenever OpenAI rolls it.
- **Not** added to the picker: a rolling alias is a pin-on-purpose model, not a curated default. Same treatment as `sonnet-4.5` and `opus-4.6` — resolvable, just not featured.
- Registered with neither `reasoning` nor `agentic`, matching its upstream categories. Claiming reasoning would mis-route it into the REASONING tier and silently raise its per-model timeout from 60s to 180s.

`toolCalling: true` is **live-verified on both** — gateway probes returned structured `tool_calls` arrays (`get_weather` + valid JSON args, `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`), no textual leak.

Routing tiers are untouched: neither model is benchmarked, and a $30/$180 model does not belong in a fallback chain reached by an automatic tier decision.

---

## v0.12.233 — July 24, 2026

Syncs **Claude Opus 5**, which Anthropic shipped and blockrun added on launch day (blockrun `src/lib/models.ts`, [#283](https://github.com/blockrunai/blockrun/pull/283)).

### Added — Claude Opus 5 (Anthropic flagship)

- **`anthropic/claude-opus-5`** registered in `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`: **$5/$25** per 1M, **1M context**, 128K max output, reasoning + vision + agentic tool use. Anthropic bills the 1M window at standard rates, so there are no long-context tier fields to model. Verified against both source-of-truth planes — the live gateway (`GET /api/v1/models`) and blockrun's registry, which lists it in the featured array with `fallbackModel: anthropic/claude-opus-4.8`.
- Added to `top-models.json` at rank 2 (picker + default-model allowlist), the README premium pricing table, and the SKILL catalog line.
- Inserted at the head of the in-family Opus fallback chain in **four** routing tiers — premium COMPLEX + REASONING, agentic COMPLEX + REASONING. Cost-neutral, so no tier primary moved: premium COMPLEX stays on `claude-fable-5`, and the `auto`/`eco`/`free` profiles are untouched.
- `clawrouter doctor opus` now runs on Opus 5 (`DOCTOR_MODELS` in `src/doctor.ts`), same `~$0.01` estimate.

### Changed — bare `opus` alias promoted to Opus 5

- **`opus`, `anthropic/opus`, and `blockrun/opus` now resolve to `anthropic/claude-opus-5`** (previously 4.8). New explicit pins `opus-5` / `opus-5.0` / `opus-5-0` / `anthropic/claude-opus-5-0`.
- The generic-alias rule is "only move it with the cost tradeoff argued explicitly" — here the tradeoff is **zero**. Opus 5 is $5/$25 with a 1M/128K envelope, identical to 4.8 on every axis that can bill or truncate a caller, so no wallet with a per-call cap changes behavior. blockrun made the same call upstream, repointing its `clawrouter-premium` redirect from 4.8 to Opus 5 on launch day; leaving `opus` on 4.8 would have made the proxy disagree with the gateway it fronts. Contrast `kimi`, deliberately left on K2.7 in v0.12.229 because K3 is ~5x the price.
- **Every 4.x pin stays routable** — `opus-4.8`, `opus-4.7`, `opus-4.6`, `opus-4.5` and their `anthropic/claude-opus-4-N` forms are unchanged, as are the generation-generic `opus-4` / `anthropic/claude-opus-4` (they name the 4-series, not "newest"). Pinned by `src/models.test.ts`.
- `selector.ts` savings baseline stays on `claude-opus-4.7` — pricing-identical, so no change to the savings math.

### Fixed — stale premium COMPLEX primary in the docs

- `README.md` and `docs/routing-profiles.md` both still listed the premium COMPLEX primary as `claude-opus-4.8`; it has been `claude-fable-5` ($10/$50) since v0.12.221. Corrected in both.

---

## v0.12.232 — July 20, 2026

Fixes a cost-control hole: requests using OpenAI's current `max_completion_tokens` field were priced as if they had asked for nothing.

### Fixed — `max_completion_tokens` was never read

- OpenAI deprecated `max_tokens` in favour of `max_completion_tokens`, but ClawRouter only ever read the legacy field. Every request from a client on the modern field was sized at the 4096 default no matter how much output it actually requested — the string `max_completion_tokens` did not appear anywhere in `src/`.
- That number is not cosmetic. It feeds the routing decision, `estimateAmount` (balance pre-check), **the strict-mode `maxCostPerRun` cap**, `chargedOutputTokens` in `logUsage`, and the pre-auth reuse check. A request asking for 65536 output tokens was priced at 1/16th of its real cost and **walked straight through a cost cap the user had set** — reproduced in `src/proxy.max-tokens-cap.test.ts`, which fails with HTTP 200 before the fix and 429 after.
- The same gap sat in `src/payment-preauth.ts`, where it sized the request at **0** tokens: a payment authorization cached for a tiny request could be reused to pay for a much larger one.
- Both now share `resolveMaxTokens()` (new `src/max-tokens.ts`, kept separate to avoid a `proxy` ↔ `payment-preauth` import cycle). It reads either field, ignores values that cannot be a token budget (`NaN`, `Infinity`, negatives, non-numbers — any of which would silently disable the cap comparison), and when a client sends both takes the **larger**: over-estimating only makes the pre-check stricter, under-estimating defeats it.
- Affects all 55+ models; the exposure scaled with output price, so `moonshot/kimi-k3` ($15/M out) was the worst case.

---

## v0.12.231 — July 20, 2026

Syncs **Qwen3.7 Max**, which blockrun added and endpoint-probed on 2026-07-20 (blockrun `src/lib/models.ts`). Thanks **[@KillerQueen-Z](https://github.com/KillerQueen-Z)** ([#215](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/215)).

### Added — Qwen3.7 Max (Alibaba flagship)

- **`qwen/qwen3.7-max`** registered in `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`: Alibaba's Max tier resold through blockrun's OpenRouter credit pool, **1M context**, 65K max output, reasoning + agentic tool use. Priced at COGS $1.475/$4.425 per 1M (users pay ~$1.55/$4.65 after blockrun's 5% margin). Added to `top-models.json` (picker + allowlist), the README mid-range table, and the SKILL catalog line.
- Explicit pins **`qwen3.7-max`**, **`qwen-3.7-max`**, and **`qwen3-7-max`** — both punctuation conventions, matching the `sonnet-4.6` / `sonnet-4-6` pattern.
- `reasoning: true` also enrolls the id in `REASONING_MODEL_IDS`, raising its per-model timeout from 60s to 180s. Noted inline so the longer stall on a hung upstream isn't a surprise.
- **`toolCalling: true` is live-verified, not assumed.** An end-to-end request through the gateway returned a structured `tool_calls` array (`get_weather` + valid JSON arguments, `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`) — no textual leak of the kind Kimi K3 ([#213](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/213)), Gemini ([#189](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/189)) and GPT ([#193](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/193)) produce. Streaming, all three pins, and the unbound bare `qwen` were verified against the live gateway in the same pass.

### Unchanged — by design

- **Bare `qwen` stays unbound.** Every other `qwen*` shorthand resolves to a FREE model (`qwen-coder`, `qwen-thinking`, `qwen3-next`, `qwen3.5-122b`), so binding the shortest name to a $1.475/$4.425 flagship would silently bill callers who typed it expecting the free tier. Same rule that keeps generic `kimi` on K2.7 — address the flagship explicitly. (`grok` was promoted to 4.5, but only with the cost tradeoff argued on the record; there's no such case for qwen yet.) A regression test pins this.
- **Routing tiers untouched.** No benchmarks yet to justify promoting a $4.425/M-out model into the cheap coding fallbacks.

---

## v0.12.230 — July 18, 2026

Fixes **[#213](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/213)** — Kimi K3 tool calls leaking into OpenClaw as plain assistant text.

### Fixed — tool-aware recovery of nameless argument blobs (Kimi K3)

- ClawRouter already synthesizes structured `tool_calls` from four textual leak shapes (OpenClaw XML, Anthropic `<invoke>`, Gemini transcript, GPT named-JSON). Each needs the tool **name** inside the text. Kimi K3 instead emits the tool's **arguments** as a bare JSON object with no `name`/`type` field — the name is only in the preceding prose (`Let's do web_search.\n{...}`) or absent entirely (`{"path":...,"action":"read"}`, `{"cmd":[...],"timeout":...}`) — so none of them fired and the JSON leaked to the chat channel.
- `extractTextualToolCalls(content, { tools })` now takes the request's `tools` schema and, as a final pass, resolves a nameless blob to a declared tool by: (a) a tool name mentioned in the preceding prose, or (b) a **unique** parameter-signature match (every blob key is a declared param — with `cmd`↔`command` aliasing for the terminal tool — and all required params present). `proxy.ts` passes the request tools at both the streaming and non-streaming recovery sites.
- **Conservative by construction** — the new pass never fires unless the request actually declared tools, and never on an ambiguous/zero signature match, so a legitimate JSON answer is never hijacked into a tool call. Backward-compatible: callers that pass no tools behave exactly as before.

## v0.12.229 — July 17, 2026

Syncs **Kimi K3**, which blockrun added and live-probed on 2026-07-17 (blockrun `src/lib/models.ts`).

### Added — Kimi K3 (Moonshot flagship)

- **`moonshot/kimi-k3`** registered in `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`: 2.8T-param open MoE, **1M context**, image + text input, returns `reasoning_content`. Priced at COGS $3.00/$15.00 per 1M (users pay ~$3.15/$15.75 after blockrun's 5% margin). Added to `top-models.json` (picker + allowlist), replacing the now-hidden `moonshot/kimi-k2.7`, and to the README model table + SKILL catalog line.
- New explicit pin **`kimi-k3` → `moonshot/kimi-k3`**.

### Unchanged — by design

- **Bare `kimi` / `moonshot` / `kimi-k2` aliases stay on K2.7** ($0.95/$4.00). K3 is ~5x the price, so repointing the generic alias would silently ~5x every generic-`kimi` quote and break per-call-cap wallets — mirrors blockrun's own alias decision (and the grok-4.5 precedent). Address the flagship explicitly.
- **Routing tiers still primary on K2.7.** K3 is not wired into any tier primary or fallback: at $3/$15 a failover in the cheap Kimi coding tiers would spike cost, and promotion needs benchmarks we don't have yet.
- K2.7 registry entry + pins remain routable (blockrun hid it, didn't retire it).

---

## v0.12.228 — July 17, 2026

Catches up with blockrun's **2026-07-17 live free-model re-probe** (blockrun PR #257, landed hours before v0.12.227 was cut against the older 07-11 map) and the **flat $0.002/tx settlement fee** introduced upstream on 2026-07-14.

### Changed — free tier follows the 07-17 re-probe

- **`free/deepseek-v4-flash` recovered** (3.2s on both probe passes) — un-hidden upstream and back in the advertised free 8. Added to `top-models.json` (picker + allowlist), the eco SIMPLE fallback chain, the `FREE_MODELS` auto-pick cascade, and the README/SKILL free lists. At 1M context it's the largest-context free model.
- **`free/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct` died** (">60s / DEGRADED", both passes) — dropped from the picker and docs. The registry entry and explicit pins (`qwen3-next`, `qwen3-next-80b`) stay routable; the gateway redirects them to `gpt-oss-120b`.
- **`FREE_MODELS` auto-pick cascade pruned**: `free/qwen3.5-122b-a10b`, `free/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct`, and `free/llama-4-maverick` removed — all three are hidden + server-redirected to `gpt-oss-120b`, so keeping them in the cascade would silently serve gpt-oss to users who had `/exclude`d it. Cascade is now the two gpt-oss defaults + the live 8.

### Changed — aliases mirror blockrun's current redirect map

- Dead-model redirect targets moved off dead models: everything that pointed at `free/llama-4-maverick` (itself dead now) or diverged from the server map is re-aimed — `nemotron-ultra`/`-253b`/`-super`/`-49b`/`-120b`, `llama-free`, `devstral-2-123b` → `free/gpt-oss-120b` (the server's universal live target); `mistral-free` → `free/mistral-large-3-675b`; `mistral-small` → `free/mistral-nemotron`; bare `nemotron` → `free/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning` (strongest live Nemotron); `qwen-thinking` → `free/gpt-oss-120b` (no live free Qwen remains).
- `nvidia/mistral-small-4-119b`'s local redirect is **removed** — it recovered in the re-probe and blockrun dropped its server redirect, so pinned callers reach the real model again. Same for the two hidden-but-routable nemotron supers: pins now pass through instead of being rewritten to a dead model.
- `nvidia/glm-4.7` now pins to `free/glm-4.7` (gateway redirects) instead of being locally rewritten to seed-oss-36b.

### Changed — pricing mirrors the upstream $0.002/tx settlement fee

- blockrun now adds a flat **$0.002 per-transaction fee on every paid product** (covers gas; included in the 402 quote). `estimateAmount()` mirrors it so balance pre-checks and usage logs track the real charge; free models never pay it. Payments themselves were always server-quoted — this only fixes the local estimate.
- README pricing intro updated: headline switches from "starting at $0.0002/request" (no longer true with the fee) to the free tier, and the fee is documented next to the per-request cost note.

---

## v0.12.227 — July 17, 2026

**The picker and every user-facing surface now match the advertised blockrun.ai catalog** (verified against the live `/v1/models` on 2026-07-17, mirroring the same alignment shipped in hermes-plugin-clawrouter 0.3.10).

### Changed — top-models picker aligned with the advertised catalog

- `src/top-models.json` goes 47 → 44 entries. Removed the 7 ids no longer advertised by the gateway: `xai/grok-4-0709`, `xai/grok-4-1-fast-reasoning`, `xai/grok-3`, `free/gpt-oss-120b`, `free/gpt-oss-20b`, `free/qwen3.5-122b-a10b`, `free/llama-4-maverick`. Added the 4 newly advertised free models: `free/mistral-nemotron`, `free/step-3.7-flash`, `free/nemotron-nano-9b-v2`, `free/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl` — the free block now equals the live 8-model NVIDIA tier exactly.
- Router internals are untouched on purpose: the removed ids stay hidden-but-routable at the gateway (verified against blockrun source — catalog `available:true, hidden:true`, or MODEL_REDIRECTS to a successor), so existing fallback chains and pinned users keep working. This only changes what pickers advertise. The allowlist sync in `index.ts`/`update.sh` prunes the stale `blockrun/*` keys from users' configs on next start.
- `top-models.test.ts` sentinels re-pinned (`grok-4.5`, `claude-fable-5`, `free/step-3.7-flash` in; retired ids asserted out).

### Fixed — image aliases pointed at models the gateway can no longer serve

- `dalle`/`dall-e`/`dall-e-3` aliases (models.ts + `/cr-imagegen`) targeted `openai/dall-e-3`, which the gateway 400s ("Delisted 2026-05-25: OpenAI removed dall-e-3 from the API"). They now route to the successor `openai/gpt-image-2`. `flux`/`flux-pro` targeted `black-forest/flux-1.1-pro`, which has no gateway entry at all — removed.
- New aliases for the current image catalog: `gpt-image-2`, `seedream` (→ `bytedance/seedream-5-pro`), and `/cr-imagegen` parity aliases for `grok-imagine`/`grok-imagine-pro`/`cogview`. IMAGE_PRICING drops the two dead entries and adds `bytedance/seedream-5-pro` ($0.045 base / $0.09 at 2K-class, matching blockrun's IMAGE_MODELS). The images usage-log fallback model is now `google/nano-banana` (the real `/cr-imagegen` default) instead of dead dall-e-3.

### Changed — README + skills refreshed to the current catalog

- README: free-tier references switch from retired `nvidia/gpt-oss-120b` to `free/mistral-large-3-675b` (the new default free model); the free pricing block lists the live 8; grok-4.5 gets a pricing row ($2.50/$9.00, 500K); rows for grok-4-0709/grok-4-1-fast-reasoning/grok-3/grok-3-mini removed; kimi-k2.6 → kimi-k2.7; routing-tier examples use advertised models only; image table now shows gpt-image-2 + seedream; `~38` → `~44` model-count mentions.
- `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md`: the "7 free" vs "8 free" contradiction is fixed (it's 8), Available Models adds claude-fable-5 + grok-4.5 and drops retired ids, image tool row updated.
- `skills/imagegen/SKILL.md`: dalle/flux rows replaced with gpt-image-2 + seedream (with the legacy-alias note), triggers and size guidance updated.

## v0.12.226 — July 14, 2026

Salvages the two pieces of #206 that were still worth having, with thanks to @0xCheetah1. The rest of that PR either shipped in v0.12.221–223 or was superseded by v0.12.225; it's closed with a full accounting.

### Fixed — `clawrouter setup` couldn't find OpenClaw under a stripped PATH

- Detection was `command -v openclaw` and nothing else. npm runs lifecycle scripts with a stripped PATH, so a perfectly working global install is invisible there and setup would exit telling the user to install what they already have. Verified: under `env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`, `command -v openclaw` finds nothing while the install is right there.
- Now falls back through `npm_config_prefix`, `npm root -g`, `~/.npm-global/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, and `/usr/local/bin`.

### Added — bare Gemini Pro shorthands

- `gemini-pro`, `gemini-3-pro`, and `gemini-3.1-pro` resolve to `google/gemini-3.1-pro`. `gemini-3-pro` was never a real id — the 3-series Pro shipped as `-preview`, then 3.1 — but callers reach for it anyway and got a 400.
- These are bare aliases, so they're advertised as their own `/v1/models` rows while the canonical `google/gemini-3.1-pro` catalog entry (with its real pricing) stays unshadowed. Pinned by a test, since a slash-prefixed key would have shadowed it instead. `/v1/models` goes 205 → 208; no aliases lost.

---

## v0.12.225 — July 14, 2026

**The circular dependency is gone at the source**, plus `grok` now tracks the 4.5 flagship.

### Fixed — `@blockrun/llm` was pinned to the version that caused the v0.12.220 disaster

- We depended on `@blockrun/llm: ^2.11.0`, which resolves to **2.13.0 — and 2.13.0 lists `@blockrun/clawrouter` as a dependency.** That back-dependency is the root of the whole v0.12.220 collapse: it's what let `noExternal` inline a stale published copy of ourselves, bloat dist to 10.2MB, and collide the tsup banner into a load-time `SyntaxError`.
- **`@blockrun/llm` 3.x demotes it to a peer** — `3.6.1`'s `dependencies` are just `bs58` and `viem`; `@blockrun/clawrouter` moved to `peerDependencies`. It is _not_ gone, but npm will not install a package into itself, so our own `node_modules` no longer receives a stale published copy at all — `npm ls @blockrun/clawrouter` reports `(empty)` and `node_modules/@blockrun/` contains only `llm`. That removes the hazard at its source for our build, rather than aliasing around it. Verified `BlockrunClient` and `createPaymentPayload` (our only imports, in `src/polymarket/fund.ts`) are unchanged across the 2→3 major.
- **Install size is unchanged (~247MB)** and this release does not claim otherwise. `@blockrun/llm` declares `@solana/spl-token`, `@solana/web3.js`, and `@anthropic-ai/sdk` as `optionalDependencies`, which npm installs by default; `spl-token`'s `@solana/codecs@2.0.0-rc.1` chain is what drags in `typescript` (23MB). `--omit=optional` takes the tree to 202MB and the router still works, but the honest fix is upstream.
- The tsup alias and the smoke check's stale-copy assertion **stay** — they're now belt-and-braces that re-arm automatically if anything ever reintroduces the cycle.

### Changed — `grok` now resolves to Grok 4.5 (deliberate cost increase)

- `grok` moves from `xai/grok-4.3` to `xai/grok-4.5`, xAI's current flagship. **This costs more**: $2.50/$9.00 vs $1.50/$4.00, and upstream re-prices the whole request at $5/$18 once prompt tokens reach 200K. What it buys is a direct-xAI SKU — 4.3 is OpenRouter-only and silently drops Live Search while still charging for it.
- Pin `grok-4.3` to opt out. Explicit `grok-4.5` / `grok-4-5` pins are unchanged. Now covered by a test so the tradeoff can't be flipped silently.

### Also in this release

- `scripts/update.sh` / `scripts/reinstall.sh` no longer wipe other plugins from `plugins.allow` (#207, thanks @0xCheetah1). The old cleanup kept a hardcoded list of bundled plugin IDs and **silently deleted every bare plugin ID not on it** — local/custom plugins, and any bundled plugin added to OpenClaw after that list was written. Now it removes only ClawRouter's own entries.

---

## v0.12.224 — July 14, 2026

**Two thirds of what we published was sourcemaps.** No behaviour change.

### Changed — stop shipping sourcemaps to npm

- The tarball carried `dist/index.js.map` and `dist/cli.js.map` at ~17MB each: **34MB of a 50MB install, 68% of the package**, downloaded by everyone who has ever run `npx @blockrun/clawrouter` or installed anything that depends on us. Excluded via `"!dist/**/*.map"` in package.json `files`. **50.0MB → 16.6MB unpacked** (3.4MB packed).
- `sourcemap: true` stays in `tsup.config.ts` — maps are still generated for local debugging and CI, they just no longer ship. The bundles keep their `//# sourceMappingURL=` comment; a missing map is silently ignored at runtime. Verified the published tarball runs both normally and under `node --enable-source-maps`.
- Context: this only became visible while auditing why `@blockrun/mcp` was paying ~50MB (≈15% of its install tree) for a router it never called. See `@blockrun/llm@3.6.0`, which stops installing us for consumers that don't route.

---

## v0.12.223 — July 14, 2026

**Hotfix again: v0.12.222 could not be installed as an OpenClaw plugin.** Plus a repair for the model list that kept showing retired models.

### Fixed — v0.12.222 was uninstallable as a plugin (P0, self-inflicted)

- `openclaw plugins install @blockrun/clawrouter` failed outright on v0.12.222:
  `Plugin "clawrouter" installation blocked: dangerous code patterns detected: Shell command execution detected (child_process) (scripts/smoke-dist.mjs:65)`.
  The dist smoke check added in v0.12.221 is a **build-time** gate, but `scripts` is in package.json `files`, so it shipped — and OpenClaw scans a plugin's loose script files and blocks the whole install over a `child_process` import. Excluded via `"!scripts/smoke-dist.mjs"`. (`dist/` is exempt from that scan; the proxy legitimately spawns processes.)
- The smoke check now asserts on the **real `npm pack` file list** that no shipped `scripts/*.mjs` imports `child_process`, so this cannot recur. Verified it fails the build when the exclusion is removed.

### Fixed — the picker kept listing retired models

- OpenClaw keeps a **third** model-list plane at `~/.openclaw/agents/<agent>/agent/models.json`, separate from the two in `openclaw.json` (`models.providers.blockrun.models` = picker, `agents.defaults.models` = allowlist). Nothing ever synced it, so it rotted independently and kept serving long-dead models.
- Measured on a real machine: after `clawrouter setup` had already repaired `openclaw.json` to the correct 47, this cache still held **155 entries — 127 retired** (`gpt-5.2`, `gpt-4.1`, `o1`, `gpt-5-mini` …), duplicate `free` and `moonshot/kimi-k2.5` rows, and **none** of the current flagships. That is the stale/duplicate rows people were seeing.
- `setup` (and gateway start) now repairs it: 155 → 47, correct order, dupes gone. It only touches an existing `blockrun` provider, never creates one, and preserves other providers plus `baseUrl`/`api`/`apiKey`. Ordering is compared positionally, since order is what the picker renders.
- `setup`'s closing hint said "you should see ~38 BlockRun models" — hardcoded and wrong since v0.12.184. Now derived from the actual list.

### Known issue — OpenClaw rejects the repair through its own writer

- `openclaw plugins install` still ends in `Config write rejected: openclaw.json (size-drop:76642->25200)`. OpenClaw guards against large config shrinks, and pruning 155 stale models → 47 _is_ a large shrink, so it rejects the write and rolls the install back — restoring the stale list. `clawrouter setup` is unaffected (it writes directly and is the supported repair path), and the plugin itself registers fine (provider, 26 tools, all commands).
- This is OpenClaw-side, so ClawRouter does not work around it: reaching into OpenClaw's internals to force it is what we deliberately are not doing. **Run `clawrouter setup` to repair the list.**

---

## v0.12.222 — July 14, 2026

**Hotfix: v0.12.220 was unusable and v0.12.221 was only half-fixed — upgrade to this one.** Plus Claude Fable 5 and Grok 4.5.

> v0.12.221 (published earlier the same day, superseded within the hour) renamed the banner identifier and added the models, which un-bricked the CLI. But it treated the symptom: it still inlined a stale copy of ClawRouter into its own bundle (10.2MB). v0.12.222 fixes the actual cause. If you are on v0.12.221 it works — but upgrade anyway.

### Fixed — v0.12.220 shipped a dead CLI (P0)

- Every entrypoint in v0.12.220 threw `SyntaxError: Identifier '__cjs_createRequire' has already been declared` at load time. `clawrouter` would not start, `import "@blockrun/clawrouter"` would not load, and `@blockrun/mcp` — which reaches us transitively through `@blockrun/llm` — could not boot either (thanks @0xCheetah1, spotted in #206; independently reported against `@blockrun/mcp`).
- **Root cause — we bundled a stale copy of ourselves.** We and `@blockrun/llm` depend on each other, and `noExternal: [/.*/]` inlines it. v0.12.220's Polymarket port added `src/polymarket/fund.ts`, our first-ever `import` of `@blockrun/llm` — so its `import { route, ... } from "@blockrun/clawrouter"` resolved through `node_modules` to the **last published build of this package**, and esbuild inlined that entire stale bundle beside the one it was building. The old copy carried its own `__cjs_createRequire`, and esbuild cannot rename around a banner it never sees (banners are raw text injected _after_ bundling) — hence the collision. Fixed by aliasing that back-import to our own source so it dedupes into the graph: **dist drops 9.8MB → 7.4MB**, one ClawRouter again instead of two shadowing each other with separate module state. Left unfixed, each release would have inlined the previous one — ~20MB next publish.
- Also renamed the banner identifier to `__blockrun_createRequire`, so no bundled dependency can ever collide with it again.
- **Why CI published it anyway**: the release pipeline runs `build && typecheck && test`, and none of those ever load `dist/`. Added `scripts/smoke-dist.mjs`, wired as `postbuild`: it imports `dist/index.js`, runs `dist/cli.js --version`, and asserts no stale ClawRouter is inlined (a loadable bundle would otherwise hide that). It fails the build (exit 1), so this class of defect can no longer reach npm.

### Added — Claude Fable 5 (relisted upstream)

- `anthropic/claude-fable-5` is back: Anthropic restored the offer on 2026-07-06 after the 2026-06-13 delisting, and BlockRun relisted it. Mythos-class tier above Opus — $10/$50, 1M context, 128K output, always-on thinking.
- `fable` / `fable-5` / `fable-5.0` / `anthropic/fable` now resolve to the real model again instead of redirecting to `opus-4.8`.
- Restored as the **premium** COMPLEX primary, reverting the forced 2026-06-13 downgrade (`opus-4.8` moves back to first fallback). The `auto` profile is untouched — its COMPLEX primary stays `google/gemini-3.1-pro`, so default routing costs nothing extra.

### Added — Grok 4.5

- `xai/grok-4.5`, xAI's flagship (added upstream 2026-07-13). $2.50/$9.00 base, 500K context, vision, Live Search capable. Picker-visible; added to the premium COMPLEX fallback chain as a 503-resistant flagship.
- Reachable via explicit `grok-4.5` / `grok-4-5` pins. The generic `grok` shorthand **stays on `grok-4.3`** — 4.5 costs ~1.7x more and re-prices the entire request at 2x above 200K prompt tokens, so promotion waits on benchmarks.
- Local pricing records the base rate only; the registry has no field for the long-context tier. This skews `logUsage` telemetry on >200K calls, never the charge — payments are server-dictated via 402.

### Verified

- Both models exercised end-to-end through the built proxy with real x402 payments settled on Base, including alias resolution (`fable` → `anthropic/claude-fable-5`, `grok-4.5` → `xai/grok-4.5`).
- `/v1/models` advertises 205 entries (was 201): +2 catalog, +2 aliases, with all 118 friendly aliases intact.

## v0.12.220 — July 10, 2026

Direct Polymarket **betting** — ported from blockrun-mcp v0.30.0's `blockrun_polymarket` tool. ClawRouter could already read prediction-market odds (`blockrun_predexon_*`); now it can place, manage, and redeem **real-money** bets on Polymarket (CLOB V2, Polygon), signed locally by the same wallet that pays for LLM calls.

### New `blockrun_polymarket` tool (REAL MONEY)

- Unlike every other ClawRouter tool it is **not** an HTTP-proxy wrapper — it runs a local trading engine (`src/polymarket/`, ~2,650 lines ported from blockrun-mcp) that signs CLOB V2 orders (EIP-712) and posts them to Polymarket through BlockRun's Tokyo egress relay by default (so it works out of the box in geoblocked regions; every order is still signed locally, the relay can't move funds).
- One multiplexed tool, `action:` = `setup / fund / buy / sell / cancel / orders / positions / redeem / withdraw`.
- **Signer = ClawRouter's own EVM wallet** (`~/.openclaw/blockrun/wallet.key`, or `BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY`) — the same key that pays x402 LLM fees. A chain-agnostic private key pays API fees on Base _and_ authorizes bets on Polygon. This is the one real adaptation from the blockrun-mcp source (which used `~/.blockrun/.session`); everything else is a faithful port. Polymarket state (L2/builder creds, deposit-wallet vault) is stored under `~/.openclaw/blockrun/` alongside the wallet.
- **Funds**: bets spend **pUSD** in a gasless Polygon deposit-wallet vault; `action:"fund"` moves the user's **Base USDC → pUSD** gaslessly (x402 `POST /v1/polymarket/fund`, $0.01 fee, non-custodial via the Polymarket bridge); winnings `withdraw` back to native USDC on Base.
- **Safety** (unchanged from source): `confirm:true` is **hard-required** to place/sign anything (omit → dry-run preview); per-order cap `POLYMARKET_MAX_BET_USD` (default $25, fail-closed on garbage), optional `POLYMARKET_MAX_SESSION_USD`. Betting is deliberately NOT gated on the x402 API budget ledger — bets are the user's own pUSD, a different asset in a different chain.

### Wiring, deps, docs

- Registered in `src/index.ts` alongside the partner tools via `api.registerTool()` (a local-execute tool, not a proxy entry). New `blockrun_predexon_*` → `blockrun_polymarket` discover-then-trade loop.
- New deps: `@polymarket/clob-client-v2@1.0.8`, `@polymarket/builder-relayer-client`, `@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk`, `axios`, `https-proxy-agent`, `@blockrun/llm` (for the gasless funding path). `@solana/kit` stayed deduped at v5.5.1 (no version split).
- New `polymarket-trading` skill (golden rules, mental model, end-to-end flow) + a "Prediction-Market Trading" section in the headline `clawrouter` skill.
- 12 new tests (tool shape, fail-closed cap parsing, underscore-header proxy bridge, no-network trade-gating). Full suite: 667 passing.

## v0.12.219 — July 10, 2026

Add OpenAI's GPT-5.6 family (GA 2026-07-09) — three fixed tiers Sol/Terra/Luna — and route generic aliases to the stable Terra tier rather than the flaky Sol tier ([#202](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/202), thanks [@0xCheetah1](https://github.com/0xCheetah1)).

### GPT-5.6 Sol / Terra / Luna registered

- Added `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` ($5/$30, deepest-reasoning flagship), `openai/gpt-5.6-terra` ($2.50/$15, balanced everyday tier), and `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` ($1/$6, cost-efficient/latency tier) to `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`, mirroring BlockRun's source-of-truth `models.ts`. All three are 1M context / 128K output. Previously reachable only via raw passthrough of the full model ID.
- All three added to `top-models.json` (Terra first) so they appear in the `/model` picker and the default-model allowlist.

### Generic aliases resolve to Terra, not Sol ([#202](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/202))

- **Issue:** `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` requests failed with upstream `server_error` / HTTP 500 after very long (~250s) waits during the GA window — the deepest-reasoning tier is unstable under long-horizon load. Because callers pinned Sol explicitly, ClawRouter (correctly) retried Sol rather than substituting a different model, burning ~251s per attempt.
- **Fix:** the generic shorthands `gpt5`, `gpt-5.6`, and `openai/gpt-5.6` now resolve to the stable **Terra** tier. Explicit tier pins (`gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`) stay exact, so Sol remains reachable for callers who want the deepest tier and accept the risk. `gpt5` was bumped off `gpt-5.5` to the newer 5.6 generation.
- **Router:** `openai/gpt-5.6-terra` inserted into the COMPLEX fallback chains of the `auto`, `premium`, and `agentic` profiles (ahead of `gpt-5.5`). Sol is deliberately kept out of all auto-routing — it is opt-in only. No tier primaries changed (promotion needs benchmarks we don't have).
- **Not a ClawRouter bug:** GPT-5.6's tools-require-`reasoning_effort:"none"` rule is already handled server-side in BlockRun's `openai-passthrough.ts` (`requiresReasoningEffortNoneWithTools`), so no client-side param rewriting was needed. The 500s are genuine upstream instability, which the alias/routing choices route around.

---

## v0.12.218 — July 9, 2026

ERC-8021 builder-code attribution on x402 payments (with a preserve-existing-codes fix from the OpenClaw side), plus the `/model` picker now honors `top-models.json` order.

### Builder-code service attribution on every x402 payment ([#198](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/198), thanks [@KillerQueen-Z](https://github.com/KillerQueen-Z))

- New `src/builder-code.ts`: every x402 payment ClawRouter signs is stamped with BlockRun's CDP-registered ERC-8021 Schema 2 service code (`builder-code.info.s: ["bc_5hucoh0l"]`) via an `onAfterPaymentCreation` hook in `proxy.ts`, so BlockRun-originated traffic is attributed on-chain. The CDP facilitator reads `builder-code.info.s` from the payload and encodes it into settlement calldata — no CBOR/encoding client-side. Any app code (`a`) the server echoes back in its 402 is preserved. Safe to stamp post-creation: the EIP-712 signature covers the authorization, not the extensions.
- **Note:** this feature merged to main on July 5 but was **not** in the npm `v0.12.217` package (that release shipped from the sonnet-5 branch before #198 landed) — v0.12.218 is the first npm release that stamps builder codes.

### Preserve pre-existing service codes when stamping ([#199](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/199) → [#200](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/200), thanks [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete))

- **Bug (caught pre-npm-release):** `withBuilderCodeServiceCode()` replaced any existing `builder-code.info.s` array with `[BLOCKRUN_SERVICE_CODE]`. ERC-8021 defines `s` as an array of related service codes — if another layer (e.g. OpenClaw itself) had already added its attribution, ClawRouter erased it before settlement. Found by Peter Steinberger while validating the ClawRouter bump in `openclaw/crabpot`.
- **Fix:** valid pre-existing string entries in `info.s` are retained (non-string junk filtered out), BlockRun's code is appended only when absent, and the function still returns a fresh array without mutating the payment challenge. 3 regression tests added (existing attribution retained, partially malformed array, idempotent re-stamp).

### `/model` picker now follows `top-models.json` order ([#201](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/201), thanks [@0xCheetah1](https://github.com/0xCheetah1))

- `VISIBLE_OPENCLAW_MODELS` was built by _filtering_ `OPENCLAW_MODELS` through the `top-models.json` set, so the picker showed registry declaration order, not the curated order. It is now built by _mapping_ `top-models.json` → registry entries, so `src/top-models.json` alone controls both membership **and** order.
- Curated list reordered: routing profiles first (`auto`, `premium`, `eco`, `free`), then flagship paid models grouped by vendor (Anthropic → OpenAI → Google → xAI → Z.AI → MiniMax → Moonshot → DeepSeek), free NVIDIA models last. Merge resolution keeps v0.12.217's `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` in the Anthropic block (after the Opus pair, before Sonnet 4.6).
- New regression test asserts the visible picker IDs match `top-models.json` exactly (length + element order), which also guards against dangling IDs in the JSON that have no registry entry.

Full suite **654 passed**, typecheck + lint + Prettier + build clean.

## v0.12.217 — June 30, 2026

Model registry alignment: add **`anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`**, BlockRun's newest Sonnet — near-Opus coding/agentic quality at Sonnet cost.

### New model: Claude Sonnet 5

- BlockRun added `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` (source-of-truth `blockrun/src/lib/models.ts`): **$3/$15 — identical to Sonnet 4.6** but with **1M context / 128K output / adaptive thinking / vision**, described as "near-Opus coding/agentic quality at Sonnet cost." BlockRun routes it direct-Anthropic with `fallbackModel: claude-sonnet-4.6`.
- **ClawRouter** (`src/models.ts`): added to `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` (flows into `OPENCLAW_MODELS` automatically) and to the `/model` picker (`src/top-models.json`).
- **Aliases:** explicit `sonnet-5` / `sonnet-5.0` / `sonnet-5-0` shorthands added. **Bare `sonnet` / `claude` deliberately stay on Sonnet 4.6** — Sonnet 5 is opt-in, mirroring BlockRun's own alias map (which does not repoint the shorthand) and the v0.12.167 "add-distinct, don't silently upgrade the bare alias" precedent.
- **Routing** (`src/router/config.ts`): inserted as an in-family fallback wherever Sonnet 4.6 appears (auto COMPLEX quality fallback, gpt-5.3-codex MEDIUM, opus COMPLEX, plus the three Sonnet-primary chains — auto REASONING, agentic COMPLEX, agentic REASONING). **No primaries promoted** — promotion awaits benchmarks (Sonnet 5 is brand-new, not yet in BlockRun's Bedrock map), matching the v0.12.168 gpt-5.5 fallback-only pattern. Cost-neutral in every chain ($3/$15 = Sonnet 4.6).
- README pricing table + `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` model list refreshed. All 645 tests pass.

## v0.12.216 — June 30, 2026

Security + dependency hygiene: clear all 22 Dependabot alerts (**`npm audit` → 0 vulnerabilities**) and fix a latent missing-dependency bug in the upstream-proxy feature.

### `undici` is now a declared dependency (fixes the upstream-proxy feature for clean installs)

- **Latent bug:** `src/upstream-proxy.ts` lazy-imports `undici` (`await import("undici")`) to honor `BLOCKRUN_UPSTREAM_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY`, but `undici` was **never declared** in `dependencies` — it only resolved because `openclaw` (a dev/peer dependency) hoisted `undici` to the install root. `npm ls undici --omit=dev` confirmed no shipped runtime dep provides it, so a clean `npm install -g @blockrun/clawrouter` could leave the proxy feature unable to load undici (caught + warned, then connecting directly). **Fix:** declare `undici@^8.5.0` (the patched version) as a direct dependency — the proxy feature now works regardless of hoisting, and the undici advisories are resolved at the source.

### Dependency updates

- **openclaw** dev/peer dependency bumped `2026.5.7 → 2026.6.10` (in range), clearing all `openclaw` and transitive `@mariozechner/pi-*`, `markdown-it`, `tar`, `undici` advisories.
- **esbuild** pinned to `^0.28.1` via `overrides` (joining the existing `basic-ftp` / `ws` / `postcss` pins), clearing GHSA-g7r4-m6w7-qqqr (dev-server arbitrary file read, Windows-only — not reachable here, but pinned for cleanliness).
- All alerts were dev-time/lockfile-only — the **published runtime footprint had no vulnerable deps**; this commit makes the lockfile and dependency declarations honest.

### Test fix

- `test/integration/security-scanner.test.ts` located openclaw's scanner chunk by the `skill-scanner-*.js` name; openclaw 2026.6.10 renamed it to `scanner-*.js`. Broadened the filter to match both prefixes (the loader already disambiguates by the `scanDirectoryWithSummary` export). Full suite **645 passed**, lint + typecheck + build clean.

## v0.12.215 — June 30, 2026

Recover tool calls that GPT 5.4 emits as plain JSON / function-call-looking text instead of structured `tool_calls` ([#193](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/193), thanks [@0xCheetah1](https://github.com/0xCheetah1)).

### GPT-5.4 plain-text tool calls now become real tool calls

- **Symptom:** through the OpenAI-compatible path, GPT 5.4 sometimes emits a tool call as assistant text instead of structured `tool_calls` — e.g. `{"type":"function","name":"terminal","parameters":{"cmd":"ls -alh /home/Blockrun"}}`, `{"name":"session_search","parameters":{…}}`, `read_file(parameters={"path":"…"})`, or a `terminal\nCOMMAND\n[/terminal]` block. Downstream chat surfaces (seen in Chermes/Telegram) then **displayed the raw text** to the user instead of dispatching the tool — the same class of failure as the Gemini #189/#190 fix, but with GPT-specific shapes.
- **Fix:** added a fourth recognizer to `src/textual-tool-calls.ts` (which already synthesizes structured calls from OpenClaw `<tool_call>`, Anthropic `<function_calls>`, and Gemini `[Called function …]` text shapes). The GPT extractor recovers: whole-content `{"name":…,"parameters":…}`, whole-content `{"type":"function",…}` (incl. pretty-printed), whole-content `NAME(parameters={…})`, a trailing JSON object after prose **only when `"type":"function"` is explicit**, and the `terminal\n…\n[/terminal]` block. Guardrails: prose JSON examples only fire when the whole content is a call; an incomplete terminal block or a non-`function` `type` (e.g. a JSON schema `"type":"object"`) is rejected; the terminal `cmd` arg is mirrored to `command` (preserving `cmd`) for OpenClaw's terminal tool. It runs only when the tag-based extractors find nothing, so it can't interfere with tagged content. Both call sites — streaming and non-streaming in `proxy.ts` — share this function.
- **Tests:** 14 new cases in `src/textual-tool-calls.test.ts` (all five shapes plus no-mis-fire on prose examples, missing `parameters`, incomplete terminal block, non-`function` type, and `cmd`→`command` normalization). Full suite **645 passed**, lint + typecheck + prettier + build clean.

## v0.12.214 — June 28, 2026

Recover tool calls that Gemini 3.5 Flash emits as plain-text transcripts instead of structured `tool_calls` ([#189](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/189)).

### Gemini `[Called function "…" with args: {…}]` transcripts now become real tool calls

- **Symptom:** through the OpenAI-compatible path, Gemini 3.5 Flash sometimes narrates a tool call as assistant text — `[Called function "terminal" with args: {"command":"whoami"}]` — instead of returning structured `tool_calls` with `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`. Downstream chat surfaces (seen in Chermes/Telegram) then **displayed the transcript** to the user instead of dispatching the tool, stalling agent loops.
- **Fix:** added a third recognizer to `src/textual-tool-calls.ts` (which already synthesizes structured tool calls from OpenClaw `<tool_call>` and Anthropic `<function_calls>` text shapes). The new extractor locates `[Called function "NAME" with args: ` and parses the JSON args with a **balanced-brace scan** that honors string literals — so commas, braces, and `]` inside the JSON can't truncate the match. It only fires when the args parse as a JSON object **and** the block is closed by `]`, so prose that merely quotes the format doesn't mis-fire. Both call sites — streaming and non-streaming in `proxy.ts` — share this function, so the recovered call is forwarded as a proper `tool_calls` delta/message with empty content and `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`.
- **Tests:** 8 new cases in `src/textual-tool-calls.test.ts` (single/multi-arg, empty args, nested JSON with embedded brackets, multiple transcripts with prose stripping, no-mis-fire on missing bracket / non-object args). Full suite **631 passed**, lint + typecheck + build clean.
- **Out of scope:** the issue's secondary `[Tool "function" returned]: {…}` display line is a downstream chat-surface rendering concern, not a ClawRouter normalization gap — left untouched.

## v0.12.213 — June 26, 2026

Fix an HTTP 500 (`Failed to parse payment requirements`) that broke paid Base-chain calls whenever a small request seeded the pre-auth cache before a larger one ([#188](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/188), thanks [@KillerQueen-Z](https://github.com/KillerQueen-Z)).

### Pre-auth no longer reuses a stale amount under per-request pricing

- **Root cause:** the pre-auth cache (`payment-preauth.ts`) is keyed `path:model` and stores a single signed amount, but BlockRun prices each call on `input tokens + max_tokens` — so the **same model costs different amounts** across requests. When a later request needed more than the cached amount, the signed payment underpaid; the gateway rejected it with a 402 that is **not** a fresh x402 challenge, and the old code reused that rejection as the challenge → `getPaymentRequiredResponse` threw → **HTTP 500**.
- **Impact:** every paid Base model failed once a cheaper request seeded the cache before a larger one (any growing/agentic usage — Codex, long contexts). Reproduced on a clean `npx @blockrun/clawrouter@latest`: 12/12 paid models failed `tiny→large`; a 10-turn coding conversation failed ~50% of turns. **Not** affected: free models (no payment) and **Solana** (`skipPreAuth`).
- **Fix (three guards):** (1) **never knowingly underpay** — reuse a cached pre-auth only when the up-front `estimateAmount` (already used for balance checks) proves the cached amount still covers this request; (2) **safety net** — if a pre-auth is rejected anyway, discard it and re-request **without** payment to get a fresh, canonical challenge, never treating the rejection as the challenge; (3) **fail safe** — when no estimate is available, skip pre-auth rather than risk an underpay. The fast path (cached amount covers the request) still pre-signs and skips the 402 round-trip; only would-be underpays fall back to the normal flow.
- **Tests:** new `src/payment-preauth.test.ts` (reuse-when-covered / skip-on-growth / reject-then-refetch / no-estimator); full suite **623 passed**, lint + typecheck clean.

## v0.12.212 — June 22, 2026

Stop advertising delisted/redirect aliases in `/v1/models` ([#187](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/187), thanks [@KillerQueen-Z](https://github.com/KillerQueen-Z)).

### Model list no longer surfaces full-slug redirect aliases

- **`MODEL_ALIASES` mixes two kinds of keys** — friendly short names (`free`, `opus`, `gpt-120b`) and full `provider/model` redirects for backward-compat + delisted models (e.g. `free/deepseek-v4-pro` → `free/deepseek-v4-flash` after V4 Pro's NVIDIA host hung 2026-04-30). `ALIAS_MODELS` turned **every** alias into a listable model, so dead slugs leaked into `/v1/models` (and any downstream picker) as if they were real, available models — a Codex picker built from `/v1/models` showed "DeepSeek V4 Pro (free)" that silently routes to v4-flash.
- **Fix: only surface friendly short aliases (no `/`).** Full-slug redirect aliases are skipped from the advertised list — their target is a real model that's already listed, so nothing the user wants disappears. They remain **fully callable** via `resolveModelAlias()` (which reads `MODEL_ALIASES` directly), so pinned callers don't break. One-line filter in `ALIAS_MODELS`; `MODEL_ALIASES` and resolution logic are untouched.
- **Scope confirmed:** the OpenClaw picker (`VISIBLE_OPENCLAW_MODELS` / `top-models.json`) and the `openclaw.json` allowlist sync are unaffected — every picker entry is a real catalog id, never an alias key. Three delisted-redirect aliases that are _also_ real catalog ids (`openai/o1-mini`, `nvidia/kimi-k2.5`, `google/gemini-3-pro-preview`) drop off the HTTP discovery surface as well — intended: all three are dead redirects whose live successors stay listed, and all stay callable.

### Maintenance

- Formatted `test/test-e2e.ts` (a pre-existing `prettier --check` failure that was red-lining the **Lint & Typecheck** required check on every PR) and added `.pytest_cache/` to `.gitignore`.

## v0.12.211 — June 18, 2026

Add Z.AI's new flagship **GLM-5.2** (launched 2026-06-16), aligning with BlockRun's source-of-truth catalog (`zai/glm-5.2`, first in the GLM lineup).

### GLM-5.2 added

- **`zai/glm-5.2` added to the catalog** — 1M-token context (262K max output), paid per-token at $1.40/$4.40 (same rate as GLM-5.1, cached $0.26). Z.AI's newest flagship: beats GPT-5.5 on long-horizon coding at a fraction of the cost. Categories: chat, reasoning, coding.
- **Bare `glm` alias retargeted** GLM-5.1 → **GLM-5.2** (bare alias always tracks the newest flagship). New `glm-5.2` explicit shorthand added. `glm-5.1` explicit pin preserved as the 200K-context predecessor (identical price, so no cost-stability tradeoff — kept for behavioral parity).
- **Picker visibility** — added to `top-models.json` (head of the GLM group), so it surfaces in the OpenClaw `/model` picker and the allowlist sync on next provider refresh. README Mid-Range pricing table updated.
- No router-tier changes: GLM models are accessed by alias/direct call, not wired into any auto/eco/premium tier chain — GLM-5.2 follows the same path. All 619 tests pass.

---

## v0.12.210 — June 16, 2026

Align the free tier with BlockRun's 2026-06-14 free-tier refresh (`blockrun` commit `5817ecd`: self-healing health gate + probe-verified NVIDIA lineup). BlockRun found only 7 of 17 "available" free models were actually being served and replaced the stale manual redirect list with a per-model circuit breaker.

### Free models realigned with the probe-verified lineup

- **`free/qwen3-coder-480b` retired** — NVIDIA EOL'd it on 2026-06-14; BlockRun now redirects `qwen3-coder` → `seed-oss-36b` server-side. Dropped from the auto-pick cascade (`FREE_MODELS`), the picker (`top-models.json`), and the router COMPLEX backstops. The catalog entry + explicit `nvidia/qwen3-coder-480b` alias stay for pinned callers (BlockRun still resolves them via redirect); the generic coding shorthands (`qwen-coder`, `glm-free`, `devstral`, …) now point at the live successor `free/seed-oss-36b`.
- **`free/deepseek-v4-flash` removed from the eco SIMPLE fallback** — NVIDIA upstream hung; BlockRun redirects it. Replaced with the live `free/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct`. Catalog entry kept (still direct-callable, redirects server-side).
- **6 new live free models added** to the catalog + aliases (probe-verified by BlockRun): `free/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct` (262K ctx, reasoning + coding), `free/seed-oss-36b` (coding), `free/mistral-nemotron`, `free/step-3.7-flash` (reasoning), `free/nemotron-nano-9b-v2` (fast lightweight), `free/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl` (vision-language).
- **Auto-pick cascade 7 → 12**, gpt-oss kept at the head (heavy-user default — never retired). Picker free set 7 → 8 (`qwen3-coder-480b` → `qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct` + `seed-oss-36b`). README/SKILL free-count synced 7 → 8; install-script `/model` help echoes refreshed to live models.

### Updater: clean stale OpenClaw install metadata ([#186](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/186), thanks [@0xCheetah1](https://github.com/0xCheetah1))

- **`scripts/update.sh` now removes ClawRouter's stale record from `~/.openclaw/plugins/installs.json` after a verified update.** OpenClaw 2026.6 migrates its plugin install index toward shared SQLite; a leftover ClawRouter `installRecords` entry that no longer matches the installed version/path made `openclaw doctor` warn about conflicting install metadata on every run. The updater now compares the legacy record against the current package across the `extensions/`, project-scoped, and global npm layouts, and removes **only** ClawRouter's record (other plugins untouched) when it is stale — guarded by a full try/catch and an atomic write.

## v0.12.209 — June 14, 2026

Registry realignment with the 2026-06-13 → 06-14 BlockRun catalog sweep: Fable 5 delisting reverted, Kimi K2.7 promoted, free tier strengthened. 619 tests passing.

### Fable 5 delisting (revert of the 06-11 promotion)

- **`anthropic/claude-fable-5` DELISTED by Anthropic 2026-06-13** (offer withdrawn upstream — no longer served on direct Anthropic or Bedrock). BlockRun removed the catalog entry and redirects fable → `opus-4.8` (`route.ts` MODEL_REDIRECTS). v0.12.208's same-day promotion of Fable 5 to **premium COMPLEX primary** was therefore pointing default premium-tier complex traffic at a now-dead model. Reverted: catalog entry removed, all `fable*` aliases (`fable`, `fable-5`, `fable-5.0`, `anthropic/fable`, `anthropic/claude-fable-5[.0]`) now resolve to `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8`, and premium COMPLEX primary restored to `opus-4.8` (its first fallback before the promotion). Pinned callers silently land on opus-4.8, matching the gateway.

### Kimi K2.7 (BlockRun commit `cd3d79b`, 2026-06-13)

- **`moonshot/kimi-k2.7` added** — Moonshot's new flagship: 256K context, multi-modal (image + **video** input), returns `reasoning_content`. AT-COST pricing **$0.95/$4.00** — identical to K2.6 (BlockRun serves it via the OpenRouter credit pool failing over to direct Moonshot; zero margin by design). Bare aliases (`kimi`, `moonshot`, `kimi-k2`) retargeted K2.6 → K2.7; explicit `kimi-k2.6` / `kimi-k2.5` pins preserved. K2.6 marked superseded (hidden on BlockRun) but stays fully routable as an **identical-cost** first fallback.
- **Router primaries promoted K2.6 → K2.7** (same price, so cost-neutral): `auto.MEDIUM`, `agentic.MEDIUM`, `premium.SIMPLE`. Each keeps K2.6 as its first fallback (in-family hot swap). K2.7 also prepended ahead of K2.6 in the premium MEDIUM/COMPLEX and agentic COMPLEX fallback chains. Picker (`top-models.json`) swapped K2.6 → K2.7.

### Free tier strengthened (BlockRun 06-14 catalog sweep)

- **Auto-pick set 6 → 7**, gpt-oss kept at the head (heavy-user default, deliberately retained despite BlockRun hiding it). Mid/back strengthened with two BlockRun-re-featured free flagships: **`free/mistral-large-3-675b`** (675B general, un-retired — NVIDIA upstream recovered) and **`free/qwen3.5-122b-a10b`** (newest-gen Qwen). `free/deepseek-v4-flash` dropped from the auto-pick set + picker (BlockRun hid it) but stays catalog-routable for direct `$0` calls. New free shorthands: `mistral-large`, `qwen3.5-122b`. eco SIMPLE fallback chain extended with both new models. README/SKILL free-count synced (6 → 7).

## v0.12.208 — June 11, 2026

Stop non-English prompts from crashing paid responses via the `x-clawrouter-reasoning` header.

- **Non-ASCII routing reasoning crashed `res.writeHead` after settlement** (`src/proxy.ts`). The routing reasoning string embeds matched keywords from the multilingual lists in `src/router/config.ts` (Cyrillic, CJK, …). Debug headers are on by default, so for e.g. Russian prompts the raw Cyrillic keywords landed in the `x-clawrouter-reasoning` response header and Node rejected the write with `ERR_INVALID_CHAR` — _after_ the upstream call had completed and the x402 payment had settled. The client never received the body and retried, signing a fresh payment each round: a paid retry loop. Header values are now percent-encoded outside printable ASCII (`sanitizeHeaderValue`, reversible via `decodeURIComponent`), and as defense in depth a rejected `writeHead` sanitizes all header values and still delivers the paid body instead of throwing. (Test: `proxy.reasoning-header.test.ts`, 13 cases, including a live Russian-prompt repro through `classifyByRules` validated against Node's `validateHeaderValue`.)
- **`CLAWROUTER_DEBUG_HEADERS=off|false|0`** — new env kill switch for the `x-clawrouter-*` debug headers, for clients that can't set the per-request `x-clawrouter-debug: false` header. Comments claiming the headers were "opt-in" corrected (they are on by default).

---

## v0.12.207 — June 11, 2026

Honor standard proxy environment variables for upstream traffic.

- **`HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` fallback** (`src/upstream-proxy.ts`). Node's fetch (undici) ignores the standard proxy env vars, so users whose system traffic is meant to flow through a local proxy (mihomo/clash without TUN mode, corporate proxies) had ClawRouter connecting _directly_ while their `curl` tests went through the proxy — on throttled routes (e.g. RU → Google-hosted gateway) this surfaced as instant 500s on large request bodies, `Premature close`, and per-model timeouts, while small requests slipped through. When `BLOCKRUN_UPSTREAM_PROXY` is unset, ClawRouter now applies the standard env vars via undici's `EnvHttpProxyAgent`. `NO_PROXY` is honored, and loopback hosts (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) are always excluded so local health checks and sibling proxies stay direct. `BLOCKRUN_UPSTREAM_PROXY` still wins when set; SOCKS URLs in the standard env vars are _not_ auto-applied (a warning points to `BLOCKRUN_UPSTREAM_PROXY=socks5://…`). (Test: `test/upstream-proxy.test.ts`, 9 cases, dependency-injected — no process-global mutation in tests.)

---

## v0.12.206 — June 10, 2026

End-to-end audit sweep: 4 proxy reliability fixes (each TDD'd with a new regression test), abort/teardown hardening, registry realignment with the gateway, and doc/count sync. 596 tests passing (8 new).

### Proxy reliability (all in `src/proxy.ts` unless noted)

- **Process-crash fix: escaped rejections from the request handler.** The `paymentStore.run(async () => …)` promise wrapping every request was never `.catch()`ed, and the media endpoints (`/v1/images/generations`, `image2image`, `audio`, `videos`) read the request body **outside** their `try` blocks — a client aborting mid-upload rejected the body iterator, escaped the handler, and became an `unhandledRejection`, which kills the whole proxy under Node's default semantics. A safety-net `.catch()` now logs, replies 500 when possible, and never lets a rejection escape. (Test: `proxy.aborted-upload.test.ts`.)
- **Partner-API corruption: `content-length` forwarded after fetch decompression.** `proxyPaidApiRequest` stripped `content-encoding` but kept `content-length`, so any gzipped upstream response (pm/exa/surf/phone/…) reached the client with the _compressed_ length and _decompressed_ bytes → truncated JSON. `content-length` joins the skip list; Node chunks instead. (Test: `proxy.partner-gzip.test.ts`.)
- **Client abort now cancels upstream work in the media + partner paths.** The image/video 202-poll loops kept polling after the client disconnected — and the first `completed` poll **settles the x402 payment**, charging the user for a clip nobody will receive. Both loops (and the partner proxy + media submit calls) now thread an `AbortController` tied to `res` close, bail before the next poll, and pass `signal` into `payFetch`. (Test: `proxy.poll-abort.test.ts`.)
- **Streaming dedup waiters get heartbeats.** A streaming retry that attached to an in-flight identical request waited in silence (no headers, no bytes) for up to minutes — recreating the OpenClaw ~10-15s timeout/retry storm the heartbeat mechanism exists to prevent, and stacking more waiters each round. Waiters now receive SSE headers + `: heartbeat` comments immediately and replay the original's transcript when it lands. (Test: `proxy.dedup-streaming.test.ts`.)
- **Balance check time-bounded at 2.5s** (`BALANCE_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MS`). The pre-request balance check runs before SSE headers; a slow RPC (Solana retry ladder ≈ 34s worst case, and zero balances are never cached) starved streaming clients of their first byte. On expiry the request proceeds optimistically; the in-flight RPC still warms the monitor cache. (Test: `proxy.balance-check-latency.test.ts`, via the existing `_balanceMonitorOverride` seam.)
- **Teardown/leak batch:** partner proxy now `res.end()`s after a mid-stream body-read timeout instead of hanging the client until socket timeout; `readBodyWithTimeout` cancels the stream on timeout (was leaking the undici connection until GC); the budget second-pass 429 path releases the global timeout + close listener; the empty-wallet fallback writes the exclude-aware `freeFallback` pick into the body instead of the hardcoded `FREE_MODEL` (latent exclude-list bypass); the 429-retry success path uses `FREE_MODELS.has()` like its siblings (phantom ~$0.001 session-budget entries); the video poll loop tracks an explicit `completed` flag so a completed-but-empty job no longer reports as "timed out"; `payment-preauth.ts` reuses the rejected pre-auth 402 (which already carries fresh requirements) instead of buying an identical 402 with an extra unpaid round trip.
- **Hot-path perf:** `estimateAmount` now uses a module-level `Map` (the budget pre-check scanned `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` linearly per model → O(n²) per request); `loadExcludeList` (`src/exclude-models.ts`) gained an mtime-validated cache.

### Registry / pricing (gateway alignment, blockrun = source of truth)

- **`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` added** ($3/$15, 200K ctx, vision) — public upstream since the 4.6 launch but missing here entirely; same gap class v0.12.167 fixed for opus-4.5. Pins: `sonnet-4.5`, `sonnet-4-5`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`. Bare `sonnet` stays on 4.6; not picker-listed (superseded tier).
- **Seedance i2v telemetry rates un-discounted** — blockrun `403e61e` (2026-06-01) removed the image-to-video discount; the stale `pricePerSecondImageInput` rows (0.13369/0.1742) under-logged i2v cost ~41%. i2v now logs at the text rate. Telemetry-only (payments are server-dictated). Known remaining gap, documented in the comment: blockrun's `RESOLUTION_TOKEN_FACTOR` (1080p = 2.25×) still isn't modeled.
- **`azure/sora-2` added to `VIDEO_PRICING`** ($0.10/s flat, 4s default — a 12s clip was falling back to the generic ~$0.42 telemetry row) and **`openai/gpt-image-2` added to `IMAGE_PRICING`** ($0.06 / $0.12 by size). Both added to README + SKILL docs.
- **Duplicate-id picker entries eliminated** (`src/models.ts`): catalog entries shadowed by an identically-keyed alias (`free`, `openai/o1-mini`, `google/gemini-3-pro-preview`, `nvidia/kimi-k2.5`) are now excluded from `OPENCLAW_MODELS` — `resolveModelAlias` checks aliases first, so those catalog entries were unreachable and advertised the _old_ model's metadata while callers got the redirect target. The picker's double `free` row is gone (39 → 38 = `top-models.json`), and the surviving `free` entry finally says **GPT-OSS 120B** instead of the retired "Nemotron Ultra 253B". (Tests added in `models.test.ts`.)

### Docs / cleanup

- **Free-model count corrected everywhere: 6** (was variously 8, 9, and 10 across README badges/prose and SKILL.md — stale since the 2026-06-07 sweep). README profile table AUTO·MEDIUM cell synced to `kimi-k2.6 ($0.95/$4.00)` (changed in v0.12.174); ECO·REASONING cell named the actual primary (`grok-4-1-fast-reasoning`); doctor sample output and CLAUDE.md now say Node 22 (floor raised in #183).
- **Dead code removed:** `src/router/llm-classifier.ts` (designed LLM-fallback classifier, never wired), the vestigial `walletKeyAuth`/`envKeyAuth` interactive auth methods in `src/auth.ts`, `decompressContent` (codebook), `generatePathMapHeader` (paths); two internal-only functions un-exported.
- **`@noble/hashes` declared as a direct dependency** — `src/wallet.ts` imports it directly but it only resolved via `@scure/*` hoisting (phantom dep; masked at runtime by tsup bundling). Stale tsconfig `exclude` of `error-classification.test.ts` dropped (it typechecks fine).

## v0.12.205 — June 8, 2026

Finished de-listing `nvidia/mistral-small-4-119b` after the gateway hid + redirected it (2026-06-08).

- **`nvidia/mistral-small-4-119b` fully de-listed** — the gateway now marks it `hidden` and server-redirects it to `nvidia/llama-4-maverick` (NVIDIA upstream timing out, 3/3 probes >60s). All five alias targets that still resolved to `free/mistral-small-4-119b` (`nvidia/mistral-small-4-119b`, `nvidia/mistral-large-3-675b`, `free/mistral-large-3-675b`, `mistral-free`, `mistral-small`) now resolve to `free/llama-4-maverick`, matching the gateway. Removed from the model catalog and the `/model` picker (`top-models.json`); README budget row dropped. (Test pricing fixture kept as a generic $0 entry.)

## v0.12.204 — June 8, 2026

Free-tier routing realigned to the backend's 2026-06-07 model sweep.

- **`nvidia/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking` removed** — NVIDIA end-of-life 2026-05-21 (HTTP 410; server redirects to `nvidia/llama-4-maverick`). Dropped from the auto-pick set, the `/model` picker (`top-models.json`), the eco-tier fallback chain, and the model catalog. All 15 alias/redirect targets that pointed at it (the nemotron family, `qwen-thinking`, `qwen3-next`, the `nvidia/qwen3-next…` identity) now resolve to `free/llama-4-maverick`, matching the gateway.
- **`nvidia/glm-4.7` de-listed from auto-pick + picker** — NVIDIA NIM deployment hung; the gateway redirects it to `nvidia/qwen3-coder-480b`. Its aliases (`nvidia/glm-4.7`, `glm-free`) now resolve to `free/qwen3-coder-480b`. (Catalog entry kept so direct `free/glm-4.7` calls still price at $0.)
- **`nvidia/mistral-small-4-119b` dropped from auto-pick + eco fallback** — upstream timing out (3/3 probes >60s). Still directly callable (alias resolution intact, officially `available` server-side); just no longer a smart-routing target. README annotated.

---

## v0.12.203 — June 6, 2026

- **GLM flat pricing fully retired (backend d840de7).** Z.AI's remaining flat $0.001/call promos ended 2026-06-06: `zai/glm-5` now bills per-token at $0.60/$1.92 and `zai/glm-5-turbo` at $1.20/$4.00 (glm-5.1 stays $1.40/$4.40). Their permanent `flatPrice` fields are removed so payment pre-estimation sizes per-token again; the `flatPrice` mechanism itself stays for any future flat-billed SKU. README pricing rows updated.

---

## v0.12.202 — June 6, 2026

- **Upstream delistings mirrored (gateway health probe 2026-06-06).** `openai/o1-mini` 404s at OpenAI and `google/gemini-3-pro-preview` 404s at Google; the gateway hid both and redirects them (`o1-mini` → `o4-mini`, `gemini-3-pro-preview` → `gemini-3.1-pro`). ClawRouter mirrors the redirects in `MODEL_ALIASES` (pinned callers land on the successor instead of an upstream error), drops gemini-3-pro-preview from the picker, and removes it from the AUTO COMPLEX fallback chain (it would have silently resolved to the tier primary anyway).

---

## v0.12.201 — June 5, 2026

- **Catalog sync with BlockRun backend (2026-06-04/05 model drops + repricing).**
  - **New xAI models** (`src/models.ts`, `src/top-models.json`): `xai/grok-4.3` ($1.50/$4.00, 1M ctx, reasoning + vision + agentic) and `xai/grok-build-0.1` ($1.50/$3.00, 256K, agentic coding) — both resold via BlockRun's OpenRouter credit pool and public in the backend catalog, so both are picker-visible. Aliases: bare `grok` promoted `xai/grok-3` → `xai/grok-4.3` (grok-3 and the 4-fast/4-1-fast families are now hidden on BlockRun; explicit IDs still resolve). `grok-code` repointed `deepseek/deepseek-chat` → `xai/grok-build-0.1` (xAI again has a real coding SKU); new pins `grok-4.3`, `grok-build`. The delisted `grok-code-fast-1` redirects stay on cheap chat.
  - **`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` added to the catalog** ($0.435/$0.87 — the 75% launch promo became DeepSeek's permanent list price after 2026-05-31; 1M ctx, reasoning + agentic). Fixes a latent picker bug: `top-models.json` already listed it, but with no `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` entry the `VISIBLE_OPENCLAW_MODELS` filter silently dropped it. `deepseek-chat`/`deepseek-reasoner` entries refreshed from stale V3.2 ($0.28/$0.42, 128K) to V4 Flash ($0.20/$0.40, 1M).
  - **GLM flat pricing modeled correctly** (`src/models.ts`): new permanent `flatPrice` field on `BlockRunModel` (backend `billingMode: "flat"`; takes precedence in `getActivePromoPrice`). `zai/glm-5` and `zai/glm-5-turbo` switch from an expired promo (ended 2026-04-15 in our metadata) to permanent flat $0.001/request — they had been mis-estimated per-token for 7 weeks. `zai/glm-5.1`'s promo end corrected to 2026-06-05 (when BlockRun actually ended it); it now bills per-token $1.40/$4.40.
  - **Router untouched:** tier primaries/fallbacks in `src/router/config.ts` are benchmark-driven; grok-4.3 / grok-build-0.1 / v4-pro enter routing only after they get benchmark rows.
  - **Docs:** README pricing tables refreshed (deepseek V4 rows, glm flat rows, grok-4.3 / grok-build-0.1 / minimax-m3 / glm-5.1 added); `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` model list updated.

---

## v0.12.198 — May 29, 2026

- **Claude Opus 4.8 is now the Anthropic flagship.** BlockRun's source-of-truth model registry (`blockrun/src/lib/models.ts`) shipped `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8` as its current featured flagship — $5/$25 per 1M (identical to 4.7), 1M context, 128K output, adaptive thinking, `fallbackModel: claude-opus-4.7`. This release aligns ClawRouter:
  - **Model registry** (`src/models.ts`): added `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8` to `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` (mirrors the 4.7 spec — 1M ctx, 128K out, reasoning/vision/agentic/tools).
  - **Aliases** (`src/models.ts`): bare `opus`, `opus-4`, `anthropic/opus`, and generic `anthropic/claude-opus-4` now resolve to 4.8, matching BlockRun (where bare opus / `clawrouter-premium` redirect to 4.8). New explicit pins `opus-4.8` / `opus-4-8` / `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`. Explicit `opus-4.7` / `opus-4.6` / `opus-4.5` pins stay routable on their own version for cost-stability callers.
  - **Router** (`src/router/config.ts`): `premiumTiers.COMPLEX` primary promoted `claude-opus-4.7` → `claude-opus-4.8` (cost-neutral — same $5/$25), with 4.7 inserted as the first in-family fallback. 4.8 also inserted ahead of 4.7 in the premium REASONING, agentic COMPLEX, and agentic REASONING fallback chains. `selector.ts` baseline left on 4.7 (pricing-identical; no savings-math change).
  - **Picker** (`src/top-models.json`): added 4.8, removed 4.6 (already hidden on BlockRun). Picker now shows opus-4.8 + opus-4.7; 4.6 stays resolvable via explicit alias. Note: existing users carry stale `cfg.models.providers.blockrun.models` arrays (OpenClaw merges, never deletes), so the 4.6 removal only takes effect on a fresh prune/re-install — same caveat as v0.12.175.
  - **Diagnostics** (`src/doctor.ts`): `doctor opus` deep-analysis model bumped to 4.8 (identical cost).
  - **Docs**: README pricing tables/examples and `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` model list refreshed.
  - No provider-routing or `thinking`-block changes: 4.8's adaptive-thinking contract is identical to 4.7's, which ClawRouter has routed in production without injecting explicit thinking blocks.

---

## v0.12.197 — May 27, 2026

- **Plugin now loads at gateway boot (manifest capability declarations).** OpenClaw 2026.5.x's strict gateway-boot plugin loader requires the manifest to declare the capabilities a plugin provides. `openclaw.plugin.json` declared none (`Shape: non-capability`), so after `openclaw gateway restart` the loader silently **skipped** ClawRouter: the x402 proxy never bound `:8402`, the BlockRun provider/web-search/partner tools never registered, and `/wallet`, `/blockrun`, `/stats` etc. returned "no such command" inside the TUI. Install-time hot-reload is lenient and still loaded the plugin, which masked the regression — `openclaw plugins doctor` was the tell, repeating `clawrouter: plugin must declare contracts.tools before registering agent tools` 26×. Fix adds the four declarations the strict loader needs:
  - `contracts.tools` — the 26 partner tools registered at runtime (`blockrun_predexon_*`, `blockrun_stock_*`, `blockrun_crypto_*`/`fx_*`/`commodity_*`, `blockrun_image_*`, `blockrun_video_generation`, `blockrun_phone_*`, `blockrun_voice_*`). Verified to be an **exact match** to `src/partners/registry.ts` runtime registration — no missing, no extra.
  - `contracts.webSearchProviders: ["blockrun-exa"]` — the Exa-backed web search provider (`src/web-search-provider.ts`).
  - `providers: ["blockrun"]` — declares ownership of the `blockrun/*` model IDs (`src/provider.ts`), same pattern as `anthropic`/`openai`.
  - `activation.onStartup: true` + `enabledByDefault: true` — opt into the trusted boot-load path so the proxy comes up at gateway start instead of lazy-loading.

  Manifest-only change (static JSON read directly by the loader, not bundled into `dist/`); it does not touch the runtime config-write path, so it cannot trip OpenClaw's `baseHash` `ConfigMutationConflictError`. Closes the gateway-restart load failure on OpenClaw 2026.5.19+. Contributor credit: PR [#171](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/pull/171) by [@bogdan-velicu](https://github.com/bogdan-velicu) — first-time contributor, thorough repro + verification writeup. 🎉

- **Ships v0.12.195's Seedance pricing fix (latent stale-`dist/`).** v0.12.195 updated `src/proxy.ts` to the 720p+audio per-second rates (e.g. `seedance-1.5-pro` `$0.04375/sec` → `$0.0875/sec`), but the committed `dist/` bundle at v0.12.195 **and** v0.12.196 was never rebuilt from that source — both releases shipped the old 480p-baseline pricing, so the local `estimateVideoCost` telemetry kept under-reporting Seedance usage by ~2× (payment is server-dictated, so no overcharge — telemetry only). This release rebuilds `dist/` from current source, so the corrected Seedance per-second rates finally land in the published bundle.

---

## v0.12.196 — May 24, 2026

- **Updater recovers from OpenClaw size-drop rejection.** OpenClaw v2026.4.5+ refuses to write a config that would shrink the file by a large amount (data-loss guard). Users on a pre-v0.12.175 install carry ~175 entries in `models.providers.blockrun.models`; upgrading to a current ClawRouter legitimately trims that to ~38 (≈90 KB → 25 KB), tripping OpenClaw's guard. The updater previously surfaced this as a hard failure and rolled back, stranding users on the old version. Fix in `scripts/update.sh`: pipe the install output to a captured log, detect the `Config write rejected: …size-drop:` signature, validate the rejected payload against a conservative checklist (top-level keys unchanged, required sections present, model count actually shrank, curated count in [20, 100], non-model sections drift ≤ 2 KB, residual models section ≤ 4 KB, ≥ 65% of the drop comes from the model list), apply just the scoped model-list trim atomically (`tmp.PID` → rename), then fall through to a direct `npm pack` install of the latest version. The EXIT/INT/TERM rollback trap stays active across the fallback path so Ctrl+C still restores the previous install. Tested on a real VPS reproducing the 90728 → 25514 rejection.

## v0.12.195 — May 23, 2026

- **Seedance 720p + audio defaults aligned with blockrun re-enable.** Blockrun took the three Seedance entries offline on 2026-05-21 (`available:false`, returning `400 "not currently available"` on POST) after user reports of (1) 480p output without audio, visibly worse than JiMeng on the same prompt, and (2) the missing real-person enrollment flow. On 2026-05-22 (commit `e6dc1f1`) they re-enabled all three with `resolution=720p` + `generate_audio=true(t2v) / false(i2v)` defaults in the videos route, doubling the per-second token count from `10128` → `20256`. ClawRouter's `VIDEO_PRICING` table was sized for the 480p baseline, so the local `estimateVideoCost` was under-reporting wallet `logUsage` by ~2× for the past day (payment is fully server-dictated, so no overcharge — telemetry only, per `feedback_telemetry_vs_payment`). Updated `src/proxy.ts`:
  - 1.5 Pro: `$0.04375/sec` → `$0.0875/sec` (flat — no image discount; token360 prices text and image inputs at the same per-M rate).
  - 2.0 Fast: text `$0.11343/sec` → `$0.22687/sec`, image `$0.06684/sec` → `$0.13369/sec`.
  - 2.0 Pro: text `$0.14179/sec` → `$0.28358/sec`, image `$0.08710/sec` → `$0.17420/sec`.
  - Header comment refreshed to call out the 720p+audio default and the doubled tokens/sec.
- **5s default-call telemetry now lands at:** 1.5 Pro ~$0.46 (was $0.23), 2.0 Fast ~$1.19 text / ~$0.70 image (was $0.60 / $0.35), 2.0 Pro ~$1.49 text / ~$0.91 image (was $0.74 / $0.46). All within ~1% of blockrun's quote at the new 720p settings.
- **Discovery surfaces refreshed.** `src/partners/registry.ts` `video_generation` entry now advertises the 720p+audio defaults, declares `image_url` + `real_face_asset_id` as explicit params (both already worked via raw body passthrough — this just makes them discoverable to agents and the `/v1/partners` listing), and updates the pricing display to the new `$0.46–$2.98` range. `README.md` pricing table + explanatory paragraph and `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` headline rewritten in the same shape — the old "480p, ~10,128 tokens/sec, $0.23–$0.74 / 5s" copy from v0.12.194 is now stale on every surface.
- **No proxy whitelist or routing change.** Seedance was already in the video proxy path; the re-enable on blockrun's side restored POST without ClawRouter needing to flip any flag. Aliases (`seedance`, `seedance-1.5`, `seedance-2-fast`, `seedance-2`) and the `/videogen` slash command continue to work as before.

---

## v0.12.194 — May 18, 2026

- **Seedance video pricing aligned with blockrun's token-priced model.** Last week blockrun replaced the flat per-second Seedance pricing with `duration × tokens/sec × $/1M tokens × 1.05 margin` after a verification call against `bytedance/seedance-2.0-fast` measured 10,128 tokens/sec at 480p (token360's default, not the 720p we'd guessed). The old ClawRouter `VIDEO_PRICING` table was both wrong-shaped and ~3–4× off on the high side. Updated `src/proxy.ts`:
  - `VIDEO_PRICING` now stores base `$/sec` (no margin baked in — `estimateVideoCost` still applies the 5% margin to match server's `MARGIN_PERCENT`). Per-second values are derived from `10128 × $/1M tokens / 1e6`.
  - New optional `pricePerSecondImageInput` field per model. 2.0 Fast and 2.0 Pro charge ~40% less per token on image-to-video (token360's published image rate); 1.5 Pro stays flat because its audio-generation toggle isn't yet wired to a request param, and undercharging when audio is on by default would be silent loss.
  - `estimateVideoCost(model, durationSeconds, hasImageInput)` picks the cheaper image rate when the request body has `image_url`. The video route now parses `image_url` presence alongside `model` + `duration_seconds` and threads it into the cost callsite (`src/proxy.ts:2706, 2876`).
  - **Net effect** on the default 5s call telemetry: 1.5 Pro $0.16 → $0.23, 2.0 Fast $0.79 → $0.60 text / $0.35 image, 2.0 Pro $1.58 → $0.74 text / $0.46 image. Matches blockrun's quoted prices to within rounding. This is telemetry-only — payment is fully server-dictated via x402 (`feedback_telemetry_vs_payment`).
- **BytePlus RealFace passthrough documented (no code change needed).** blockrun added an optional `real_face_asset_id` body field (format `ta_xxxxxxxx`) on Seedance 2.0 variants for real-person character consistency across frames. The ClawRouter video route already forwards the raw request body to blockrun as-is, so RealFace works transparently — but the README + `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` headline didn't mention it. Updated both with usage notes, the per-1M-token pricing model, and the constraint that RealFace + `image_url` are mutually exclusive (both seed the first frame; pick one).
- **Surf skill refreshed against blockrun's real `/gateway/v1` catalog (83 endpoints).** The first Surf skill (v0.12.193) was drafted in parallel with blockrun's integration and ended up out of sync once blockrun:
  - Switched to `api.asksurf.ai/gateway/v1` (real public gateway, 82–83 real endpoints) and dropped 15 invented routes the skill had described.
  - Pre-validates required query params per endpoint **before settling payment** — call with a missing param and you get `400 { missing_params, all_required, docs }` and the wallet isn't charged. 56 of 83 endpoints have required params.
  - Dropped surf-1.5 chat (`/surf/chat/completions`) again pending per-token billing — calling it now returns 404 without taking payment.

  Updated `skills/surf/SKILL.md`:
  - Endpoint count 84 → 83, removed the Chat section, added the required-param pre-check note up front.
  - Fixed param names that the agent would otherwise feed incorrectly and trip the pre-check 400: `social/mindshare` is `q` + `interval` (not `project` + `window`), `search/*` family is `q` (not `query`), `token/holders` + `token/transfers` need `address` AND `chain`, `onchain/gas-price` needs `chain`, `onchain/tx` needs `hash` + `chain`, exchange family universally needs `pair`, market family uses `symbol`, prediction-market endpoints use their specific identifier params (`market_slug`, `event_slug`, `condition_id`, `market_ticker`, `event_ticker`, `ticker`, `address`), and `fund/ranking` + `project/defi/*` need `metric`.
  - Reworded the example flows that previously used wrong param names (`search/project?query=ethena` → `?q=ethena`, mindshare example fixed).

- **Phone skill — voice/call `from` is now optional with server-side auto-pick.** blockrun moved `from` from required → optional on `/v1/voice/call`. After payment verification the server picks a caller-ID from the wallet's owned numbers: 0 active → `403 no_active_number` with buy-first hint, exactly 1 → auto-used, 2+ → `400 ambiguous_from` listing all candidates. The prior skill said "Otherwise Bland picks one" — wrong, and would have made agents leave `from` off and confuse users with the 403/400 responses. Updated `skills/phone/SKILL.md` with the actual auto-pick rule table and the ownership-mismatch 403 behavior.
- **No code change for `real_face_asset_id`, no new partner tools, no proxy whitelist change.** Surf + Phone are both base+skill integrations (per the v0.12.193 rule). All blockrun upstream changes here flow through the existing `proxyPaidApiRequest` path transparently.

---

## v0.12.193 — May 17, 2026

- **Surf integration — first skill-only marketplace API.** BlockRun launched the Surf unified crypto data API ([blockrun.ai/marketplace/surf](https://blockrun.ai/marketplace/surf)) — 84 endpoints across 13 domains: CEX/DEX markets, on-chain SQL over 80+ ClickHouse tables (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, BSC, TRON, HyperEVM, Tempo), 100M+ labeled wallets, prediction markets (Polymarket + Kalshi), social/CT mindshare, news, project/DeFi metrics, token analytics, unified search, VC fund intelligence. Settles directly to Surf's Base treasury in USDC; no Surf account or API key required.
- **New release pattern: base whitelist + skill, no typed wrappers.** Earlier integrations (Predexon, Phone/Voice) wrote 200–400 lines of TypeScript per partner in `src/partners/registry.ts` — hand-authored summaries of each endpoint exposed as `blockrun_*` tools. That pattern doesn't scale: Surf alone has 84 endpoints, and the next BlockRun-marketplace API will have more. From this release forward, new partner APIs ship as a **skill** (markdown the agent reads on demand) plus a one-line addition to the proxy namespace whitelist. The agent reads `skills/<api>/SKILL.md`, crafts the HTTP call, and gets paid x402 settlement transparently. **Adding a new Surf endpoint requires zero ClawRouter release.** This matches the Anthropic Skills convention ([github.com/anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)) and aligns with how Claude Code is designed to consume capability surfaces.
- **Proxy whitelist.** Extended the partner-route regex at `src/proxy.ts` to match `/v1/surf/*`. Requests flow through the existing `proxyPaidApiRequest` (x402 handled transparently). New `isSurf` branch in the telemetry hook emits `tier: "SURF"` with `model = "surf/<operation>"` so `clawrouter stats` and `clawrouter report` see Surf usage as a distinct line — distinct from LLM, generic Partner, and Phone tiers. Updated `proxyPaidApiRequest` JSDoc + the inline route comment to document the new namespace.
- **No registry entries — no `blockrun_surf_*` tools.** Deliberate. The agent reads `skills/surf/SKILL.md` for the endpoint catalog and crafts calls to `http://127.0.0.1:8402/v1/surf/...` directly. Skip the duplication.
- **`skills/surf/SKILL.md` (new).** Full endpoint reference grouped by domain (Exchange, Market Overview, News, On-Chain, Prediction Markets, Project + DeFi, Social/CT, Token Analytics, Unified Search, VC Fund, Wallet Intelligence, Web, Chat). Pricing tier table ($0.001 / $0.005 / $0.020). Four worked example flows (wallet ID, token concentration, custom on-chain SQL with schema-fetch pattern, project mindshare lookup). Frontmatter triggers cover the natural-language queries an agent would phrase to find this skill (`"onchain sql query"`, `"wallet labels api"`, `"crypto mindshare"`, etc.).
- **`skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` headline update** — per the `feedback_skill_dual_layer` rule. Added "Crypto Data (Surf) — skill-only integration" section after Prediction Markets, explaining the new base+skill pattern and pointing at the dedicated `surf` skill. Frontmatter `description` and `triggers` extended to surface Surf capabilities. Without this headline update, agents reasoning about crypto-data tasks would skip ClawRouter even with the dedicated `surf` skill present.
- **README** — new "Crypto Data (Surf)" section between Phone & Voice and Models & Pricing, with the pricing table, three curl examples (price, batch wallet labels, on-chain SQL), and a link to `skills/surf/SKILL.md`. Notes that this is the new pattern for marketplace APIs.
- **`openclaw.plugin.json` description** — mentions Surf so the OpenClaw plugin browser surfaces the capability.
- **Tests** — new `src/proxy.surf-routing.test.ts` mirrors the partner-path regex literal and adds 10 assertions: positive matches for `/v1/surf/{market/price,onchain/sql,wallet/labels/batch,prediction-market/polymarket/markets,chat/completions}`, negative guards against `/v1/surfer/*`, `/v1/surfaces/*`, and bare `/v1/surf` (no trailing slash), plus regression guards for existing partner paths (`/v1/pm/*`, `/v1/exa/*`, `/v1/phone/*`, `/v1/voice/*`, `/v1/stocks/*`) and non-partner `/v1` routes (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/images/generations`). Mirroring the regex literal here means any silent regex edit fails loudly in CI.
- **Aborted course-correction in the same session** (process note worth recording): the first pass of this integration also added 11 typed `blockrun_surf_*` tools to `src/partners/registry.ts` (~470 lines) and generalized the `__dynamic__` handler in `src/partners/tools.ts`. Reverted both before commit on user feedback — Surf doesn't belong in `registry.ts`, and generalizing the dynamic handler without a second user would have been speculative. **Lesson:** mirroring the Predexon/Phone pattern by reflex skips the question of whether the pattern itself still scales. With Surf at 84 endpoints, it doesn't. New rule: typed partner wrappers are reserved for narrow, high-leverage APIs (≤12 endpoints, agent-facing tools that benefit from JSON-schema validation in OpenClaw). Everything else is base + skill.

## v0.12.192 — May 16, 2026

- **Phone & Voice integration — BlockRun's phone capability stack is now first-class in ClawRouter.** BlockRun shipped 8 phone endpoints earlier this cycle (Twilio for number intelligence + provisioning, Bland.ai for AI-powered outbound voice calls), all x402-gated behind `blockrun.ai/api/v1/phone/*` and `blockrun.ai/api/v1/voice/*`. ClawRouter had **zero integration** — agents reasoning about phone tasks would skip ClawRouter entirely (per the `feedback_skill_dual_layer` rule: if `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` doesn't list a BlockRun capability, AI agents ignore the local proxy and hit the gateway directly, losing wallet/telemetry/local visibility). This release closes the gap on every surface.
- **Proxy paths.** Extended the partner-route regex at `src/proxy.ts:2782` to match `/v1/phone/*` and `/v1/voice/*`. Both flow through the existing `proxyPaidApiRequest` (x402 handled transparently). New `isPhone` branch in the telemetry hook emits `tier: "PHONE"` with model = `phone/<operation>` (so `clawrouter stats` and `clawrouter report` see phone usage as a distinct line). `PHONE_PRICING` table mirrors server-side `twilio.ts` + `bland.ts` pricing (longest-prefix match handles `/voice/call/{id}` poll URLs correctly) and is used only as the telemetry fallback when the x402 paymentStore is empty — actual settlement is always server-dictated.
- **Tool registry.** Eight new entries in `src/partners/registry.ts` (`PartnerCategory` union extended with `"Communications"`):
  - `blockrun_phone_lookup` ($0.01) — carrier + line type
  - `blockrun_phone_lookup_fraud` ($0.05) — SIM-swap + call-forwarding signals
  - `blockrun_phone_numbers_buy` ($5.00 / 30 days) — provision a US/CA number tied to the wallet
  - `blockrun_phone_numbers_renew` ($5.00 / +30 days) — extend lease
  - `blockrun_phone_numbers_list` ($0.001) — wallet's active numbers
  - `blockrun_phone_numbers_release` (free) — release a number back to the pool
  - `blockrun_voice_call` ($0.54 flat, ≤30 min) — outbound AI voice call via Bland.ai
  - `blockrun_voice_status` (free) — poll call status / transcript / recording
  - Voice-call tool description carries an explicit safety guardrail: "places a REAL outbound phone call to a real number — only invoke when the user has explicitly asked." Server enforces an emergency-number blocklist; ClawRouter trusts upstream rather than duplicating the list.
- **`/cr-call` slash command** in `src/index.ts`, registered alongside `/cr-imagegen` and `/videogen`. Syntax: `/cr-call +1<E.164> "<task>" [--voice nat] [--max-duration 5] [--from +1<owned-number>] [--language en-US]`. New `parseCallArgs` helper handles both `--key=value` and `--key value` flag forms, recognizes the first `+E.164`-shaped token as the destination, and packs the rest as the natural-language task. Mode is **fire-and-forget**: the command POSTs to `/v1/voice/call`, returns `call_id` + `poll_url` immediately, and tells the user to poll for transcript when the call completes. The `cr-` prefix is mandatory — `/call` and `/phone` are even more commonly reserved by chat platforms than `/imagegen` was when v0.12.190 had to rename it; we don't register either bare form.
- **`clawrouter phone` CLI subcommand** in `src/cli.ts` covers the wallet-resource operations that don't make sense as chat slash commands:
  - `clawrouter phone numbers list` — formatted table with E.164, country, expiry-in-days, `⚠ renew soon` flag for ≤2 days remaining
  - `clawrouter phone numbers buy <US|CA> [--area-code <code>]` — provision
  - `clawrouter phone numbers renew <+E.164>` — extend lease
  - `clawrouter phone numbers release <+E.164>` — release
  - `clawrouter phone lookup <+E.164>` — quick carrier check
  - `clawrouter phone fraud <+E.164>` — quick SIM-swap check
  - All subcommands POST to the running proxy at `127.0.0.1:8402`; payment flows through the existing wallet. 402 errors render with a friendly "fund your wallet" hint.
- **SKILL.md double-layer update**, per `feedback_skill_dual_layer` rule:
  - `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` — added "Phone & Voice (Twilio + Bland.ai)" section after Image & Video, with the full 8-tool table; updated frontmatter `description` and `triggers` to mention phone capabilities. Without this headline update, AI agents would route around ClawRouter when reasoning about phone tasks even with the partner registry populated — they need to see the capability surfaced where they're already looking.
  - `skills/phone/SKILL.md` (new) — dedicated reference: full HTTP API for each endpoint, parameter tables, fire-and-forget polling explanation, three example agentic flows (verify-before-text, appointment confirmation, acquire-caller-ID).
- **README** — new "Phone & Voice Calls" section between Image Editing and Models & Pricing, with the pricing table, slash command + CLI examples, raw `curl` HTTP usage, and the same safety guardrail surfaced in the tool description.
- **`openclaw.plugin.json` description bump** — mentions phone + voice capability so the OpenClaw plugin browser surfaces it.
- **Out of scope (deferred):** local recording/transcript download (recordings can be large; returning Bland.ai's hosted URL is sufficient for v1), auto-polling voice-call status to completion in the slash command (user opted for fire-and-forget so the chat experience returns immediately), SMS/MMS (BlockRun hasn't exposed yet), auto-renew on lease expiry (CLI surfaces the warning, user decides).
- **Two telemetry bugs surfaced and fixed during real-call smoke testing** (placed an actual $0.54 call to `+15707043521` via the patched dist; tx `0xfe6c6b5e...` settled on Base; wallet reconciliation correct: $84.49 → $83.95 = exactly one $0.54 debit). Both bugs were pure logging artifacts — wallet was never wrongly debited — but they would have given misleading numbers in `clawrouter stats` and `clawrouter report`. Both fixes consolidated into a new exported pure helper `resolvePhoneTelemetryCost` (in `src/proxy.ts`) with 8 unit tests locking down the gates:
  - **Bug 1 — phantom $0.54 charge on 4xx voice POST.** First smoke test POSTed `/v1/voice/call` with empty `{}` body to exercise routing without spending money. BlockRun returned 400 (Zod validation: "expected string, received undefined"). The wallet wasn't charged, but the telemetry hook saw `paymentStore.amountUsd = 0` and fell back to `estimatePhoneCost("/v1/voice/call") = $0.54`. Stats would record a phantom voice call. Fix: gate the fallback on `upstream.status`being 2xx — any 4xx/5xx skips the fallback and logs`$0`.
  - **Bug 2 — GET poll miscounted as another $0.54 voice call.** After placing a real call, polling `GET /v1/voice/call/{call_id}` for transcript status (free upstream) was being logged at $0.54 because the longest-prefix match on `voice/call/` triggered the same fallback row as the initiating POST. Every 30s poll would inflate stats by $0.54. Fix: also gate the fallback on `req.method === "POST"` — GET polls log `$0`.
  - **Refactor**: gate logic was originally inline inside `proxyPaidApiRequest`. Pulled it out into `resolvePhoneTelemetryCost(args)` so the rules are independently testable (the call site is now four lines passing an args bag through the helper). Adds 8 vitest cases covering: paid-amount-wins, 4xx phantom guard, GET poll guard, 5xx guard, missing-method guard, non-phone-passthrough, and the original "successful POST with empty paymentStore → fallback" path. Without the helper extraction, locking these gates in tests would have required a full integration test with a mocked upstream — too heavy for telemetry-only logic.
- **Tests** — new `src/proxy.phone-routing.test.ts` (regex matching for /v1/phone/\*, /v1/voice/\*, /v1/voice/call/{id} poll, plus negative case for /v1/phonebook), `src/proxy.phone-pricing.test.ts` (longest-prefix matching + the 8 `resolvePhoneTelemetryCost` gate cases above), `src/parse-call-args.test.ts` (both flag forms, quoted task spans, E.164 first-token detection). Total 31 new test cases; all 569 vitest tests green; typecheck + lint clean.
- **Smoke test record** (free-tier verification before the real call): list-numbers ($0.001) returned an existing wallet-owned number `+15707043521` (PA, expires 2026-06-15); lookup ($0.01) on that same number returned full Twilio carrier metadata (`type: nonFixedVoip`, `carrier_name: Twilio - SMS/MMS-SVR`); negative test `/v1/phonebook/test` correctly rejected by the partner regex (502 from chat-completion fallback rather than partner routing); CLI table formatting + expiry-warning logic verified by `clawrouter phone numbers list`.

## v0.12.191 — May 14, 2026

- **`free/deepseek-v4-pro` delisted from the model picker** — NVIDIA's V4 Pro deployment has been hung since 2026-04-30 (verified: connection hangs indefinitely, no bytes returned in 300s). The model was still showing in the OpenClaw picker as `[Free] DeepSeek V4 Pro`, misleading users who selected it into getting V4 Flash via BlockRun's server-side redirect. Fix: removed from `src/top-models.json` (picker) and `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` registry; all aliases that previously pointed at it (`free/deepseek-v4-pro`, `nvidia/deepseek-v4-pro`, `nvidia/deepseek-v3.2`, `free/deepseek-v3.2`, `deepseek-free`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, `v4-pro`) now redirect directly to `free/deepseek-v4-flash` at the ClawRouter level, skipping the double-hop through BlockRun's redirect. `free/deepseek-v4-flash` (1M context, MMLU-Pro 86.2) remains the active free DeepSeek option. The entry will be restored if and when NVIDIA brings the V4 Pro deployment back online.

---

## v0.12.190 — May 13, 2026

- **`/imagegen` slash command renamed to `/cr-imagegen` to resolve Telegram channel-command collision** ([#165](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/issues/165)). Telegram bot integrations reserve `/imagegen` for their own image-gen bots (Hugging Face Spaces et al.), and OpenClaw's runtime emits `Plugin command "/imagegen" conflicts with an existing Telegram command` when ClawRouter registered the same name. The `api.registerCommand` at `src/index.ts:1768` now registers `cr-imagegen` so OpenClaw's command registry no longer fights the channel. Backward compatibility preserved: typing legacy `/imagegen <prompt>` in chat still works — the `src/proxy.ts` chat-prefix interceptor accepts both `/cr-imagegen` and `/imagegen` (slice length adjusts to whichever prefix matched). User-facing help text, partner-tool footer, README, `docs/image-generation.md`, and `skills/imagegen/SKILL.md` all updated to lead with the new name while noting the legacy form remains accepted. `/videogen` left untouched — no collision reported in the field yet, and unnecessary churn is unnecessary churn.

---

## v0.12.189 — May 12, 2026

- **Dependency refresh: x402 2.9 → 2.11, viem 2.47 → 2.48, openclaw devDep 2026.5.4 → 2026.5.7.** Routine in-range upgrade pass — no API breakage, all 531 tests green, typecheck + lint clean. Bumps via `npm update` (semver-safe) covered:
  - `@x402/core`, `@x402/evm`, `@x402/fetch`, `@x402/svm` → 2.11.0 (the payment-protocol stack; 2.10 + 2.11 are bugfix-only over the 2.9 line we shipped in v0.12.182).
  - `viem` → 2.48.11 (Ethereum RPC client used for Base USDC balance checks; the `mainnet.base.org` RPC failures visible in `~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.err.log` are external network reliability, not viem bugs — but staying on tip-of-2.x means we pick up any improved retry/timeout logic when it ships).
  - `openclaw` (devDep) → 2026.5.7 (no plugin API surface changes affecting us; we still declare `compat.minGatewayVersion = 2026.5.2` for the strict-validation regime we adapted to in v0.12.184/186).
  - `@scure/bip32` 2.0.1 → 2.2.0, `prettier` 3.8.1 → 3.8.3, `eslint` 10.2.0 → 10.3.0, `typescript-eslint` 8.58.1 → 8.59.3, `vitest` 4.1.3 → 4.1.6 — all in-range.
- **`@solana/kit` deliberately held at v5.5.1.** `npm view` shows v6.9.0 available, but `@x402/svm@2.11.0`'s nested transitive dependency tree still pins to `@solana/kit@5.5.1` (deduped to a single copy in `npm ls`). Bumping ClawRouter's top-level pin to v6 would re-introduce the dual-version split that caused `transaction_simulation_failed` on Solana payments (root-caused on 2026-03-06; see memory `feedback_solana_kit_version_split`). When `@x402/svm` updates its nested pin, we follow — not before.
- **Test fix for OpenClaw 2026.5.7 dist layout.** `test/integration/security-scanner.test.ts` was crashing with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` against the new openclaw build. Root cause: 2026.5.7 ships **two** `skill-scanner-*.js` chunks in `node_modules/openclaw/dist/` — one minified (with mangled exports `a, i, n, r, t`) and one with proper names (`scanDirectoryWithSummary` et al.). The test's `files.find((f) => f.startsWith("skill-scanner"))` picked the FIRST one alphabetically (`skill-scanner-DP5fYVFn.js`, the mangled one), found no `scanDirectoryWithSummary` named export, fell through to "first function export" — which returned the wrong function (something like `clearSkillScanCacheForTest`), returning `undefined`. Fixed by iterating **all** `skill-scanner-*` chunks and picking the one that actually exports `scanDirectoryWithSummary`. The pre-2026.5.4 "first function export" fallback path is preserved for older builds (Docker e2e harness still tests against the long tail).
- **No runtime changes; no shipped behavior changes.** Pure dependency hygiene + one test-harness fix. Existing users see identical proxy behavior; the upgrade matters mainly for users on bare `npm install -g` (who get the newer x402 client when they reinstall) and for Docker/CI environments running the e2e tests against fresh OpenClaw versions.

## v0.12.188 — May 9, 2026

- **`clawrouter share` — convert the most recent assistant response into IM-flavored markdown for paste-and-share.** The pain point: OpenClaw renders gorgeous markdown via Warp+SSH, but copy-paste to IM mangles tables / `###` headings / bold. This is a real community ask — upstream [openclaw#7909 "Add plain text copy option"](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/7909) has been OPEN since 2026-02-03 with 4 comments and a volunteer (juliabush) but no merged fix; codex review on 2026-04-30 confirms maintainers haven't given UX direction. ClawRouter sits at a unique vantage point — it sees every response body the model emits — so we can ship a CLI-side fix in days while the upstream UI fix waits. Six IM presets, each tuned to the target dialect:
  - **`feishu`** — Lark / 飞书. The headline issue: Feishu desktop renders `**bold**`, tables, emoji, lists, code blocks correctly, but treats `### foo` as literal text. The `feishu` preset converts `# / ## / ###` headings to `**bold**` and strips `---` horizontal rules (which Feishu also doesn't render). Markdown tables stay intact (Feishu renders them natively).
  - **`slack`** — Slack mrkdwn dialect. Distinct from CommonMark: Slack uses `*single-star*` for **bold** (not `**double-star**`) and `_underscore_` for _italic_. Headings → `*bold*`. Markdown links `[text](url)` → Slack's `<url|text>` syntax. `&` `<` `>` get HTML-entity escaped but not inside the link tokens. Strikethrough `~~x~~` → `~x~`. Bullet `-` → `•` for visual polish. Tables → fixed-width text inside ` ``` ` code fences (Slack doesn't render markdown tables natively).
  - **`discord`** — CommonMark-compatible (Discord supports `# ## ###` headings since 2023, plus bold/italic/strike/link). The only conversion: tables → fixed-width fenced blocks (Discord doesn't render tables natively).
  - **`telegram`** — MarkdownV2. The strict one: any unescaped `_*[]()~``>#+-=|{}.!` in body text causes the Telegram bot API to reject the message with `Bad Request: can't parse entities`. The preset tokenizes the input, hard-escapes every reserved character in plain-text spans, preserves formatting tokens (`*bold*`, `_italic_`, `` `code` ``, `[text](url)`), and packs tables into ` ``` ` pre-blocks (where escaping is unnecessary). Headings → `*bold*`. Output >4096 chars is split at line boundaries with `(i/N)` continuation suffix via `transformForTelegramSplit()`.
  - **`whatsapp`** — Same single-star bold + underscore italic dialect as Slack/Telegram. Strikethrough `~~x~~` → `~x~`. Links `[text](url)` → `text\nurl` (lets WhatsApp auto-preview the URL on its own line). Tables → fenced fixed-width text.
  - **`plain`** — Strips all markdown for IMs that render text as-is (WeChat / QQ / iMessage / LINE / Signal). Headings: `# Foo` underlined with `===`, `## Foo` underlined with `---` (visible hierarchy that survives plaintext), `###`+ stripped to body. Bold/italic/strike markers removed. Tables converted to `label: value\nlabel: value` lines (multi-column tables produce header-prefixed blocks separated by blank lines). Links → `text (url)`. Inline code ticks stripped, content kept. Horizontal rules removed.
- **The hard parts that needed real care, not just regex sprawl:**
  - **Asterisk dialect collision (Slack/WhatsApp/Telegram).** Source has CommonMark `**bold** *italic*`, target wants `*bold* _italic_`. If you naively run "double-star → single-star" first, the next pass's "single-star → underscore" eats the just-converted bold. Fix: extract `**bold**` into placeholder strings (`__CR_PH_BOLD_0__`) before italic conversion, then restore as `*bold*` afterward. Same trick for converting markdown links to Slack's `<url|text>` so the angle brackets aren't HTML-entity-escaped in the next stage.
  - **Heading conversion ordering.** First implementation converted `### foo` directly to single-star `*foo*` (for Slack/WhatsApp), which then got eaten by the italic regex. Fix: heading regex always emits double-star `**foo**`, which gets scooped into the bold-protection placeholder along with naturally-occurring bold, and restored to single-star at the end.
  - **Code-fence protection.** Two passes around `splitByFences()`: first, run table-to-fence conversion only on prose segments (so existing code blocks with stray `|` characters aren't misparsed as tables); second, re-split the result (the table conversion just generated new fences) and apply per-preset text rules only to prose, never to fence content. Otherwise the bold/italic regex would eat across fence boundaries when tables happen to contain `**` or `*`.
  - **CJK column widths.** The user's actual content is Chinese — table headers like `指标` / `数值`. CJK characters take 2 monospace columns, not 1. The plain-text table renderer counts visible width by codepoint range (CJK Unified, Hangul, Fullwidth, etc) and pads accordingly so columns stay aligned in non-tabular IMs.
  - **Plain-text horizontal-rule order.** First implementation stripped HRs (`^-{3,}$`) AFTER adding `## foo` underlines — those underlines are themselves dashes, so longer headings (≥3 chars) were getting their underlines vaporized. Fix: strip HRs FIRST, add heading underlines second.
- **Persistence: `~/.openclaw/blockrun/responses/responses-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`.** Mirrors the existing usage-log path layout (`src/logger.ts`). Each JSONL entry: `{ id, timestamp, sessionId, model, requestSummary, responseText }`. The `id` is `resp_<ms>_<hex6>` so users can refer to specific responses in `clawrouter share <id>`. `requestSummary` is the user's last message truncated to 80 chars, surfaced in `share list` so people can identify which response is which. Persistence is fire-and-forget from the request handler — errors are swallowed inside `appendResponse` so they never affect the request flow. **Privacy opt-out**: set `BLOCKRUN_RESPONSE_STORE=off` to disable. (Default on; future v0.12.x release may add a TTL or auto-prune, deliberately deferred until usage signal arrives.)
- **Hooks into `src/proxy.ts`.** The chat-completion handler already accumulates the full assistant text into `accumulatedContent` for the session journal (lines 5219–5221 streaming, 5599 non-streaming). Both branches converge at the journal `record` call near line 5635 — the response-store append fires immediately after, gated on `accumulatedContent && isChatCompletion`. The user-prompt summary is captured up front into a new outer-scope `requestSummaryForStore` variable from `lastUserMsg.content` (handles both string and multimodal content arrays).
- **Four new HTTP routes on the proxy** (added next to `/v1/models`):
  - `GET /share/list?limit=20` — paginated metadata index (id, timestamp, model, sessionId, summary, responseLength).
  - `GET /share/last?as=<preset>&sessionId=<sid>` — most-recent entry, optionally pre-rendered for a preset; `sessionId` filter prefers entries from the same OpenClaw session.
  - `GET /share/:id` — fetch a specific entry by id.
  - `GET /share/:id/render?as=<preset>` — fetch + render in one call.
- **`clawrouter share` CLI subcommand**:
  - `clawrouter share last` — render most recent response (default preset = `feishu`, override with `BLOCKRUN_DEFAULT_SHARE_PRESET` env or `--as=<preset>`), print to stdout, copy to clipboard.
  - `clawrouter share list [--limit=20]` — recent entries with id, timestamp, model, prompt summary.
  - `clawrouter share <id> [--as=<preset>]` — render specific entry.
  - `clawrouter share last --all` — write all 6 preset variants to `/tmp/claw-share-<id>-<preset>.txt` and print paths (lets users compare side-by-side and pick).
- **Cross-platform clipboard** with zero new npm dependencies. Spawns the platform-native binary: macOS `pbcopy`, Linux `wl-copy` / `xclip` / `xsel` (probed in order), Windows `clip.exe`. If none work, prints a friendly hint and continues — the rendered text is still on stdout so the user can manually copy it.
- **Test coverage**: `src/share-formatters.test.ts` adds 58 tests grouped by preset plus integration tests against a real-world equivalent of the user's screenshot (semiconductor-bubble analysis with `### 1. 估值已进入极端区域` heading + a CJK-content table). Each preset's headline behavior is asserted: `feishu` converts `###`→`**`, `slack` does the asterisk-dialect dance without corrupting bold-when-italic-is-also-present, `discord` preserves `###` (Discord supports headings), `telegram` escapes `.` `-` `(` correctly and leaves pre-block content un-escaped, `whatsapp` uses single-star bold + underscore italic, `plain` strips everything and produces `key: value` table renderings. Edge cases: code-block protection (markdown patterns inside ` ``` ` aren't transformed), tables with escaped `|`, Telegram >4096 split with `(i/N)` suffix, CJK width calculation. Total test count 457 → 515 (+58), all green; typecheck + lint clean.
- **What we deliberately did NOT do.** No PNG render (would require puppeteer ≈150MB or satori+resvg ≈30MB; the `--all` flag plus future Phase 2 hosted share both cover that need without the install bloat). No hosted share-link endpoint (depends on BlockRun server-side `/v1/share` work; a future Phase 2). No automatic share-hint injection at the end of every response (would pollute every assistant message; release-notes communication is enough). No IM auto-detection (would require telemetry; user picks via `--as` or sets `BLOCKRUN_DEFAULT_SHARE_PRESET`). No upstream OpenClaw PR yet — the `share-formatters.ts` module is a strict superset of openclaw#7909's plain-text request and is portable; future PR opportunity once we have user signal.
- **Web search opt-out: `BLOCKRUN_WEB_SEARCH=off` env var or `tools.web.search.enabled = false` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` now respected.** Two users (Mark, baconvalley) reported `blockrun-exa` keeps reappearing in their config after they edit it out. Root cause: `register()` called `registerWebSearchProvider()` unconditionally and `injectModelsConfig()` flipped `enabled` back to `true` on every plugin load — so any user opt-out got clobbered. Added `isBlockrunWebSearchDisabled()` helper consulted at both sites: when disabled, `register()` skips registration (so OpenClaw's auto-detect won't pick blockrun-exa as the active provider) and `injectModelsConfig()` leaves `enabled` untouched on disk. The legacy-`provider`-stripping migration from v0.12.186 still runs regardless — that's correctness against OpenClaw's known-providers validator, not opt-in. Log line `BlockRun web search disabled (BLOCKRUN_WEB_SEARCH=off or tools.web.search.enabled=false)` confirms the opt-out took effect. `docs/configuration.md` updated. 16 new unit tests in `src/web-search-disable.test.ts` covering env precedence over config, case-insensitive matching, defensive nesting against malformed `tools.web.search`; total test count 515 → 531.
- **Repository hygiene**: removed 5 stale root-level smoke scripts (`final-test.mjs`, `test-auto-connection.mjs`, `test-config-changes.mjs`, `test-profiles.mjs`, `test-routing-changes.mjs` — superseded by `src/**/*.test.ts` since v0.12.79) plus the long-dead `blockrun-clawrouter-0.8.25.tgz` package artifact. `AGENTS.md` (untracked, byte-identical to `CLAUDE.md`) also removed. Net −659 lines from the repo.

## v0.12.187 — May 7, 2026

- **Predexon v2 spec alignment.** BlockRun shipped Predexon v2 today (commit `ffa22d4 refactor(predexon): align endpoint registry with Predexon v2 spec`) — adds 9 new endpoints, changes the path shape of 3 wallet endpoints, and retires `polymarket/wallet/identities-batch` (the old GET-with-csv form falls through to the wildcard route, harmless if hit). Total endpoint count: 48 → 57. Confirmed live against prod via `curl https://blockrun.ai/api/v1/pm/{markets,markets/listings,sports/categories,sports/markets,polymarket/markets/keyset,polymarket/wallet/identity/0xabc,outcomes/abc}` — all return 402 ✓; `POST polymarket/wallet/identities` with `{addresses:[..]}` body also 402 ✓. **Trading API (a separate Predexon spec) intentionally not exposed** — confirmed with @1bcMax. Changes in ClawRouter:
  - **`blockrun_predexon_endpoint_call` description refreshed** in `src/partners/registry.ts`: full 57-endpoint catalog grouped as Polymarket Tier 1 / Polymarket Tier 2 wallet analytics / Polymarket Wallet Identity (v2 paths) / Cross-venue canonical (v2: `markets`, `markets/listings`, `outcomes/{predexon_id}`) / Sports (v2: `categories`, `markets`, `markets/{game_id}`, `outcomes/{predexon_id}`) / Kalshi / Limitless·Opinion·Predict.Fun / dFlow / Binance Futures / Matching. Keyset pagination variants (`polymarket/markets/keyset`, `polymarket/events/keyset`) and trade-activity (`polymarket/activity`, `polymarket/markets/{tokenId}/volume`, `polymarket/markets/{conditionId}/open_interest`) listed too.
  - **POST + body support** added to the tool runner (`src/partners/tools.ts`): two new optional params `method` ('GET' default, 'POST' for bulk identities) and `body` (JSON object as string, e.g. `'{"addresses":["0x1","0x2"]}'`). GET + query unchanged. POST defaults body to `{}` when unspecified. Method validated to `'GET'|'POST'` only. Body parses through JSON.parse with cause-attached error.
  - **Wallet identity v2 path shapes propagated** to the description: `/pm/polymarket/wallet/identity/{wallet}` (path param, was `?wallet=`), `POST /pm/polymarket/wallet/identities` (replaces `identities-batch`; body shape `{addresses:[..]}`, ≤200), `/pm/polymarket/wallet/{address}/cluster` (path param, was `?wallet=`).
  - **`skills/predexon/SKILL.md` Full Endpoint Reference rewritten**: 57 rows organized by category, marks POST endpoint, notes "Responses are raw upstream JSON (no `{ data: ... }` wrapper)" — the wrapper was removed in BlockRun commit `4530941` ("fix: remove { data } wrapper from Predexon proxy response, return raw upstream JSON"); our skill had been silently telling agents to read `response.data` even though prod stopped wrapping. Fixed.
  - **`skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md`** count refresh: "57 endpoints (Predexon v2)" + endpoint_call row updated to mention `method` + `body` params.
- **No Trading API exposure.** `polymarket/trades`, `kalshi/trades`, `dflow/trades`, `polymarket/orderbooks` etc. are historical/read-only data endpoints, not trading interfaces. No order placement, no signing, no transaction submission — confirmed with `grep` over the registry.
- **Unit-tested the new dynamic branch** with a mock-fetch harness: GET+query assembles URL params, POST+body sets request body, path-param substitution works on `/pm/polymarket/wallet/identity/{wallet}`, keyset paths route correctly, DELETE method rejected, malformed-JSON body rejected. 457 vitest tests pass; typecheck + lint clean.

## v0.12.186 — May 6, 2026

- **Predexon agent tool surface expanded from 8 → 9 tools, covering the full 48-endpoint catalog.** ClawRouter previously exposed only 8 named `predexon_*` tools to LLM agents (events, leaderboard, markets, smart_money, smart_activity, wallet, wallet_pnl, matching_markets) — but BlockRun's source-of-truth (`predexon.ts`) and the marketing site at `blockrun.ai/marketplace/predexon` already list 48 endpoints across Polymarket Tier 1 (markets/events/orderbooks/candlesticks/leaderboard/cohorts/top-holders/UMA oracle), Polymarket Tier 2 wallet analytics (PnL/positions/profiles/filter/smart-money/identity/cluster), Kalshi/Limitless/Opinion/Predict.Fun (markets + orderbooks each), dFlow (trades + wallet), Binance Futures (candles + ticks), and cross-platform matching/search. The existing 8 named tools stay (well-tuned for the most common paths); a new `blockrun_predexon_endpoint_call` is added as a catch-all with `path` + `query` params and the full endpoint directory in its description (LLMs read this as the schema's `description` field). Skill files (`skills/predexon/SKILL.md` + `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md`) updated to point at the new tool — the 48-row reference table in the predexon skill was already complete.
- **Tool runner extended for dynamic-path services** (`src/partners/tools.ts`): when `service.proxyPath === "/pm/__dynamic__"` the runner reads `path` from args (validated to start with `/pm/` and reject `..` traversal), parses `query` as JSON, and assembles the URL. Existing fixed-path tools are unaffected.
- **OpenClaw devDep bumped `^2026.4.21` → `^2026.5.4`; `minGatewayVersion` bumped `2026.4.5` → `2026.5.2`.** This is the version where strict provider/baseHash validation shipped; we now declare compat with the regime we've adapted to instead of pretending to support older permissive runtimes.
- **Fixed the v0.12.185 deferred follow-up: ClawRouter no longer mutates `tools.web.search.{provider,enabled}` on `api.config` (runtime) or `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (disk) inside the plugin install path.** Root cause discovered via Docker e2e on a clean OpenClaw 2026.5.4 image: OpenClaw runs a strict known-providers validator on `tools.web.search.provider` at TWO points — (a) config-load time before `register()` runs, and (b) `replaceConfigFile` when the install commit persists the runtime config to disk. Both reject `blockrun-exa` because the validator's known-providers list is independent of plugin registrations, causing `unknown web_search provider: blockrun-exa` and install rollback. Fix:
  1. **Removed the disk write of `provider` in `injectModelsConfig`** (previously `src/index.ts:449–457`). Wrote a forward-migration in its place: when `provider === "blockrun-exa"` is found on disk, it's deleted on the next file write — picked up automatically by `clawrouter setup --forceWrite` or first gateway start.
  2. **Removed all runtime writes to `api.config.tools.web.search.*` inside `register()`.** Earlier attempts gated them on `typeof api.registerWebSearchProvider === "function"`, but OpenClaw 2026.5.4 still auto-injects the registered provider id during install commit. Net: ClawRouter's `register()` only calls `api.registerWebSearchProvider(blockrunExaWebSearchProvider)` and lets OpenClaw's auto-detection pick it up via "Auto-detected from available API keys if omitted" (per OpenClaw schema).
  3. **`tools.web.search.enabled = true`** is set only via the file-write path in `injectModelsConfig` (gated to gateway mode or `--forceWrite`), so it lands on disk without touching the validator-flagged `provider` field.
  4. **Migration in install scripts** (`scripts/update.sh`, `scripts/reinstall.sh`) strips legacy `provider: blockrun-exa` BEFORE running `openclaw plugins install`. Combined with the in-config migration, existing v0.12.185 users are cleaned up via either path.
  5. The deactivate hook (`src/index.ts:2043`) already removes the field on uninstall — kept as belt-and-suspenders.
- **Test fix**: `test/integration/security-scanner.test.ts` previously found the scanner via "first function export" heuristic, which worked when OpenClaw minified its names. The 2026.5.4 `skill-scanner-*.js` chunk re-exports under proper names, so the heuristic returned the wrong function (one of `clearSkillScanCacheForTest` / `isScannable` / `scanDirectory` / `scanSource`) and the test crashed on undefined fields. Test now prefers the `scanDirectoryWithSummary` named export, falling back to "first function" for older builds.
- **New Docker e2e harness**: `test/docker-install/Dockerfile.openclaw-2026.5` + `run-openclaw-e2e.sh` build a clean Debian + Node 22 + OpenClaw 2026.5.4 image and exercise the full install flow — fresh install on empty config, `clawrouter setup`, validator collision repro, migration + reinstall. All assertions pass on this fresh path. Run with `docker build` then `docker run --rm`.
- **Net behavior on OpenClaw 2026.5.4**: clean install with no validator failures; `clawrouter setup` no longer needs to work around the web_search collision (still useful for bare `npm install -g` users to sync allowlist). Existing v0.12.185 users with `provider: blockrun-exa` on disk get cleaned up automatically by `scripts/update.sh` / `scripts/reinstall.sh` before install runs.
- **Edge case noted (out of scope for this fix)**: re-running `openclaw plugins install --force` after a previously failed install on a setup-populated config triggers an OpenClaw 2026.5.4 internal auto-injection that re-emits `provider: blockrun-exa` and trips its own validator. The triggering log line `[plugins] Forced web_search provider to blockrun-exa` does not appear in any deployed file (verified via exhaustive `find / | xargs grep` in the Docker container) — it's emitted from somewhere inside the OpenClaw runtime not reachable from a clean filesystem search. Not a `scripts/update.sh` flow, no user impact in normal upgrades.

---

## v0.12.185 — May 4, 2026

- **`clawrouter setup` — new CLI command for users who installed via bare `npm install -g`.** A user reported `/models` in their Telegram bot showing only 7 entries despite having `@blockrun/clawrouter@0.12.184` installed and the gateway restarted. Investigation: bare `npm install -g @blockrun/clawrouter` puts the package on disk and adds the `clawrouter` binary to PATH but performs **zero** OpenClaw integration — no `plugins.entries.clawrouter` registration, no models allowlist sync, no auth profile injection. The user's bot showed OpenClaw's hardcoded fallback default models (which include `gpt-5-nano` and `gemini-2.5-flash` — neither in our `top-models.json`) instead of our 38-entry list. Confirmed by reproducing locally on OpenClaw 2026.5.2 (`8b2a6e5`): `npm install -g` alone leaves `models list` showing 1 default entry; only `openclaw plugins install @blockrun/clawrouter` triggers our `register()` callback.
- **Fix**: `clawrouter setup` runs the missing integration steps:
  1. Detect `openclaw` on PATH (refuse to proceed if missing).
  2. `openclaw plugins install --force @blockrun/clawrouter` to register the plugin.
  3. Direct call to `injectModelsConfig({ forceWrite: true })` and `injectAuthProfile()` to populate `agents.defaults.models` (the 38-entry allowlist), `models.providers.blockrun.models` (picker), `tools.web.search.provider = "blockrun-exa"`, and `agents/<id>/agent/auth-profiles.json` with the `blockrun:default` placeholder.
  4. Tell the user to `openclaw gateway restart` to pick up the new plugin code.
- **Resilient against OpenClaw 2026.5.2's stricter validation**: 2026.5.2 added a `tools.web.search.provider` validator that rejects `blockrun-exa` until that provider is actually registered (chicken-and-egg: we register it inside our plugin, but validation runs on the openclaw.json file before plugin code executes). When this trips, OpenClaw rolls back its install record. The setup command continues anyway and runs the manual config sync — even if registration didn't stick, the user's openclaw.json gets the full 38-entry allowlist, and the bot will see all models on next gateway start. A warning prints suggesting a manual `openclaw plugins install --force @blockrun/clawrouter` retry post-gateway-start if needed.
- **`injectModelsConfig` gained an `options.forceWrite` parameter** (`src/index.ts:214`). Default `false` preserves the v0.12.184 deferred-write behavior for plugin-activation hooks; `forceWrite: true` is only used by the new `setup` CLI command since it's an explicit user action outside any install transaction. Plugin lifecycle paths (the `register()` callback at `src/index.ts:1602`) keep the unconditional defer.
- **Both `injectModelsConfig` and `injectAuthProfile` are now exported** from the package entry (`src/index.ts:2074`) so the CLI can call them directly without re-implementing the logic.
- **README updated** with explicit guidance on the two install paths: A1 (`curl … clawrouter-install.sh | bash` — recommended) and A2 (`npm install -g … && clawrouter setup` — required two-step). The pure-npm path now has a prominent warning that skipping `setup` causes the 7-models symptom.
- **End-to-end verified locally**: `clawrouter setup` ran against my own `~/.openclaw` populated `agents.defaults.models` with 39 `blockrun/*` entries (vs the prior partial state); the `models.providers.blockrun.models` picker plane synced to 39 too; auth profile written. Hit OpenClaw 2026.5.2's web_search validation as expected, but the manual sync ran around it.

**Followup (deferred)**: OpenClaw 2026.5.2's `tools.web.search.provider` validator running before plugin activation is a structural mismatch — we register `blockrun-exa` inside our plugin, but validation expects the provider to be known statically. Either OpenClaw needs to relax this check post-plugin-load, or ClawRouter should declare the web_search provider via the plugin manifest rather than at runtime. Tracked separately; today's `setup` workaround unblocks users.

---

## v0.12.184 — May 4, 2026

- **Plugin install no longer crashes OpenClaw with `ConfigMutationConflictError`.** v0.12.183 fixed the install script so `openclaw plugins install --force @blockrun/clawrouter` actually executes instead of bouncing on "plugin already exists". But once the install proceeded, OpenClaw 2026.5.2 crashed inside `commitPluginInstallRecordsWithConfig` → `replaceConfigFile` → `assertBaseHashMatches`: ClawRouter's plugin activation hook (`injectModelsConfig`) reads `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` directly from disk and writes it back atomically (via `tmp + rename`) during activation. OpenClaw's install flow holds a baseHash on that exact file from before activation; when our hook bumped the hash, OpenClaw's own commit step refused to write its install record, threw, and the install rolled back. Two fixes in two releases, same user, same Vultr box, same rollback banner — no progress.
- **Fix**: `injectModelsConfig` now skips the disk write when not in gateway mode (`isGatewayMode()` returns false during `openclaw plugins install`, `openclaw plugins list`, etc. — only true for `openclaw gateway start/restart/stop`). The in-memory mutations still compute, the info logs still print, but the `writeFileSync(tmpPath) + renameSync(configPath)` is deferred. The same hook re-runs on first `openclaw gateway start` (gateway mode = true, no install transaction in flight) and persists the changes cleanly there. New log line: `Deferring config write to first gateway start (outside gateway mode)`.
- **No regression on the gateway path.** The guard at `src/index.ts:477` only short-circuits when `process.argv` does not contain `gateway`. Sanity-tested locally: started clawrouter via `node dist/cli.js`, hit `/v1/chat/completions` with `free/gpt-oss-120b`, returned 200 in 0.6s — same as v0.12.183.
- **Why this didn't surface before today**: OpenClaw 2026.5.2 (commit `8b2a6e5`, the version on the field-reporting Vultr box) added the `assertBaseHashMatches` strict check inside `replaceConfigFile`. Earlier OpenClaw versions silently allowed plugin-side disk writes to clobber the install transaction; the conflict went unnoticed because the install record was lost but the plugin still appeared installed. With the new strict check, the conflict surfaces as a hard `ConfigMutationConflictError` and the install genuinely rolls back. The bug has been latent in `injectModelsConfig` since v0.12.176 (when active config writes from this hook were introduced); it only became user-visible with OpenClaw 2026.5.2.
- **No `scripts/` changes — no blockrun re-deploy required.** The fix is in `src/index.ts`, bundled into the v0.12.184 npm tarball. The install script at `blockrun.ai/clawrouter-install.sh` is already correct as of v0.12.183; running it again now pulls the new tarball, plugin activation skips the conflicting write, OpenClaw commits its install record, gateway starts cleanly.

---

## v0.12.183 — May 4, 2026

- **Install/update scripts no longer roll back when the plugin is already installed.** `scripts/update.sh:321` and `scripts/reinstall.sh:422` ran `openclaw plugins install @blockrun/clawrouter` without `--force`. On any machine where the plugin already lives at `~/.openclaw/npm/node_modules/@blockrun/clawrouter` (i.e. every existing user running an upgrade), OpenClaw rejects the install with `plugin already exists: ... (delete it first)` and a non-zero, non-124 exit code. The script's `|| { ... exit $exit_code; }` guard then fires, the EXIT trap rolls back to the prior install (`✗ Reinstall failed. Restoring previous ClawRouter install...`), and the user is silently stranded on the version they had — never reaching the new release.
- **Fix**: both shell scripts now invoke `openclaw plugins install --force @blockrun/clawrouter`. Per OpenClaw's own error message ("rerun install with `--force` to replace it"), `--force` is the documented and idempotent way to handle both fresh-install and upgrade flows. Applied at all four call sites (timeout-wrapped + non-timeout paths in each script).
- **PowerShell counterpart `scripts/update.ps1` already uses a different approach** — it manually `npm pack`s + `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` the plugin dir + extracts (lines 112-129), bypassing `openclaw plugins install` entirely. No bug there, no change needed.
- **Field reproduction**: a Vultr-hosted user attempted to update to v0.12.182 and saw the rollback banner. Without the manual workaround `openclaw plugins update @blockrun/clawrouter`, they would have stayed on v0.12.181 indefinitely — defeating every prior fix in this session (image polling, predexon SKILL sync, reasoning-aware timeout).
- **Note for users currently stranded**: this fix lives on npm `@blockrun/clawrouter@0.12.183` but reaches users only via `npm install -g`, `openclaw plugins update`, or the self-hosted `blockrun.ai/clawrouter-install.sh`. The self-hosted install script copy at `blockrun/public/clawrouter-install.sh` should be re-synced from this release before the next user attempts an upgrade — until that sync, a user pulling the install script via curl from blockrun.ai will still hit the broken behavior.

---

## v0.12.182 — May 4, 2026

- **Reasoning models no longer get aborted before they emit their first token.** `PER_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS` was hard-coded to 60s for every model. Reasoning/thinking-mode models (o-series, GPT-5 reasoning, Claude opus thinking, Gemini Pro, Grok reasoning, DeepSeek V4 Pro / reasoner, Kimi K2.x, Qwen3-thinking, etc. — 37 IDs total flagged with `reasoning: true` in `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`) routinely take 60–120s to produce the first token on a cold cache. ClawRouter was firing the per-attempt abort right at the moment the model was about to start streaming, so a hard-pinned reasoning model would 100% time out, and `auto`-routed reasoning fallbacks chained more reasoning timeouts back-to-back. End user surfaces this as `LLM request failed: network connection error` from the agent's HTTP client.
- **Fix**: per-attempt timeout is now model-aware:
  - `REASONING_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS = 180_000` (3 min) for any model with `reasoning: true`
  - `PER_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS = 60_000` (unchanged) for everything else
  - `timeoutForModel(id)` helper looks up the flag from `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` (computed once into a Set at module init for O(1) lookup)
  - All three AbortController setup sites updated: primary attempt loop (`src/proxy.ts:4694`), explicit-pin retry (`src/proxy.ts:4827`), and 429 backoff retry (`src/proxy.ts:4897`).
- **`DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` 180s → 300s** (5 min). The global deadline now leaves headroom for one reasoning attempt (180s) + a non-reasoning fallback (60s) + on-chain settlement (~30s buffer). Was 180s, which would have collided exactly with a single reasoning attempt and starved fallback.
- **Heartbeat path unchanged.** Streaming requests already get an immediate `: heartbeat\n\n` followed by 2s-cadence keep-alive (`src/proxy.ts:4378-4389`). Non-streaming clients can't be helped by heartbeats over HTTP/1.1; they need to extend their own client-side HTTP timeouts (or switch to streaming).
- **Diagnosed in the field**: a Telegram bot user reported `LLM request failed: network connection error` after pinning their default model to `clawrouter/free/deepseek-v4-pro`. Reproduced locally on v0.12.181 with $36 balance: V4 Pro upstream took >30s for first token, client-side curl `--max-time 30` gave up, and ClawRouter's 60s per-model abort would have fired at 60s if the upstream hadn't returned by then. New 180s window covers normal V4 Pro cold-start. (Today V4 Pro is also experiencing an upstream NIM outage that's unrelated to this fix; `auto` profile correctly routes around it to other free models.)

---

## v0.12.181 — May 4, 2026

- **Main `clawrouter` SKILL caught up to multi-venue scope.** v0.12.180 expanded the dedicated `predexon` SKILL to BlockRun's 49-endpoint registry, but the **headline `clawrouter` SKILL** (the one OpenClaw and AI agents read first to decide whether ClawRouter is relevant) still said "Polymarket prediction market data" + "8 tools, Polymarket ↔ Kalshi". That description would have steered agents away from prediction-market questions about Kalshi/Limitless/Opinion/Predict.Fun, UMA resolution status, and wallet identity — even though the proxy and the predexon SKILL handle them.
- **Updates**:
  - Front-matter `description`: now lists Polymarket, Kalshi, Limitless, Opinion, Predict.Fun, dFlow + UMA oracle + wallet identity & clustering — so the discovery layer matches the actual capability.
  - Section `### Polymarket (Predexon)` → renamed `### Prediction Markets (Predexon)`. Body rewritten as a 4-bucket summary (Markets & trading, Leaderboard & smart money, Wallet analytics, UMA oracle + wallet identity) with 49-endpoint count and accurate pricing tiers. Pointer to the dedicated `predexon` skill for the full reference.
- **No code changes, no other SKILLs changed.** The `predexon` skill itself was already complete in v0.12.180. Pure visibility/triage fix on the headline SKILL.

---

## v0.12.180 — May 4, 2026

- **Predexon skill catches up to BlockRun's 49-endpoint registry.** BlockRun shipped 10 new prediction-market endpoints on 2026-05-03 (commits `9640528` + `a06c652`, prod revisions `00442-jqf` and `00443-45g`); ClawRouter's `/v1/pm/*` catch-all whitelist already proxied them silently, but `skills/predexon/SKILL.md` documented none — so OpenClaw users and AI agents using the skill couldn't discover them.
- **New endpoints documented**:
  - **Cross-venue search** — `markets/search?q=...` ($0.005) — single call across Polymarket, Kalshi, Limitless, Opinion, Predict.Fun
  - **Other venues markets list** — `limitless/markets`, `opinion/markets`, `predictfun/markets` ($0.001 each) — closes the prior gap where only orderbooks were exposed
  - **UMA oracle resolution** — `polymarket/uma/markets?state=...` and `polymarket/uma/market/{conditionId}` ($0.001 each) — track proposal/dispute/resolution lifecycle
  - **Wallet identity & clustering** — `polymarket/wallet/identity?wallet=...`, `polymarket/wallet/identities-batch?wallets=...` (GET, not POST — upstream docs are wrong), `polymarket/wallet/cluster?wallet=...` ($0.005 each)
  - **Per-token candlesticks** — `polymarket/candlesticks/token/{tokenId}` ($0.001) — OHLCV for a single outcome token (sibling to the existing market-level `candlesticks/{conditionId}`)
- SKILL.md additions: 4 new section blocks (Search Across All Venues, Other Venues, UMA Oracle Resolution Status, Wallet Identity & Clustering), 5 new example interactions, 10 new rows in the endpoint reference table (36 → 46 documented; 3 long-standing gaps from BlockRun's 49 — `polymarket/activity`, per-market volume, open_interest — deliberately left for a follow-up). Front-matter `description` and 8 new triggers for the new categories (limitless / opinion markets / predict.fun / uma oracle / wallet identity / wallet cluster / cross-venue search).
- **No code changes.** Proxy whitelist (`src/proxy.ts:2669`) already matches `/v1/pm/*`; no new path needed. Pure docs/skill release.

---

## v0.12.179 — May 3, 2026

- **Slow image generation no longer silently breaks.** `openai/gpt-image-2` (and any future model whose generation exceeds BlockRun's 30s inline window) returns `202 + { id, poll_url, poll_instructions }` from `POST /v1/images/generations`. ClawRouter previously took that 202 body and replied to the client with `200 OK` + the queued-job stub — no `data` array, no images, no error signal. The client (OpenClaw, SDK callers, curl) saw "success" with nothing usable.
- **Fix**: mirror the existing video polling loop into `/v1/images/generations`. After the initial `payFetch` POST, if the response is 202 with `poll_url`, ClawRouter now polls `GET /v1/images/generations/{id}` every 3s (after a 2s warmup) for up to 5 minutes — exactly the pattern used for `/v1/videos/generations` since 2026-04-23. On `status=completed` the response is rewritten to the final `{ data: [...] }` body and flows through the same image-saving / localhost-rewrite path as fast models. On `failed` → 502 with details. On 5min timeout → 504 (no payment settled — server only settles on first completed poll). Client still sees a single blocking POST.
- **`/v1/images/image2image` deliberately untouched.** BlockRun's `image2image` route has no `[id]` poll endpoint and no `INLINE_GEN_TIMEOUT` — it's fully synchronous server-side, so there's no 202 path to handle. Adding speculative polling there would be dead code.
- **No payment-flow change.** `payFetch` handles wallet signing for the initial POST and each subsequent poll GET; BlockRun's `[id]` route binds the job to the payer wallet and settles idempotently on the first completed poll, identical to the video flow. `paymentStore.amountUsd` still reflects the verified-then-settled amount for `logUsage`.

---

## v0.12.178 — May 3, 2026

- **DeepSeek V4 Pro added to REASONING fallbacks (auto + eco).** Backend shipped `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` (1.6T MoE / 49B active, 1M context — strongest open-weight reasoner; MMLU-Pro 87.5, GPQA 90.1, SWE-bench 80.6, LiveCodeBench 93.5) at **$0.50 in / $1.00 out per 1M under the 75% promo through 2026-05-31** (list $2.00/$4.00 after). Wired into `auto.tiers.REASONING.fallback` after `deepseek-reasoner`/`grok-4-fast-reasoning` and into `eco.REASONING.fallback` after `deepseek-reasoner`. V4 Flash thinking (`deepseek-reasoner`, $0.20/$0.40) stays primary because it's cheaper; V4 Pro is the harder-task escape hatch.
- **DeepSeek chat/reasoner now V4 Flash semantics.** `deepseek/deepseek-chat` and `deepseek/deepseek-reasoner` (already in tier configs) had their upstream rerouted to V4 Flash non-thinking / thinking modes — repriced from $0.28/$0.42 to $0.20/$0.40 with 1M context (was 128K). No SDK source change needed — pricing fetched from `/v1/models` at runtime; tier configs got comment refresh to note the V4 Flash repricing.
- **`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` added to `top-models.json`** so the OpenClaw `/model` picker surfaces the new flagship.
- **No `FREE_MODELS` changes.** `nvidia/gpt-oss-120b` and `nvidia/gpt-oss-20b` were briefly delisted 2026-04-28 but **re-enabled 2026-04-30** with `available: true` + `hidden: true` — they no longer appear in `/v1/models` (so the picker hides them) but ClawRouter's `FREE_MODELS` set still uses them as the historical free defaults; direct calls work.

---

## v0.12.177 — May 3, 2026

- **Picker actually filtered now via the right layer.** v0.12.175 + v0.12.176 both targeted `cfg.models.providers.blockrun.models`, but per v0.11.8's checked-in design (`src/index.ts:379`), the OpenClaw `/model` picker is whitelisted by `cfg.agents.defaults.models` — that's the canonical filter. The path-based-plugin install case (where users install ClawRouter from a local checkout via `installPath = sourcePath = ...`) never runs `scripts/update.sh` / `scripts/reinstall.sh`, so the install-script prune-and-add never fires. `injectModelsConfig` in `src/index.ts` only added entries — never pruned — so retired models accumulated forever in the allowlist.
- **Fix**: `injectModelsConfig` now actively syncs `blockrun/*` allowlist entries to TOP_MODELS exactly — adds missing AND removes stale. Mirrors the install-script behavior so plugin-load-only users (no install-script flow) get correct picker visibility on next OpenClaw restart. Non-`blockrun/*` entries (other providers like OpenRouter) are preserved.
- **`/v1/models` HTTP endpoint deliberately unchanged** — keeps the full ~175-entry list including aliases, so API-level discovery and `/model <alias>` resolution stay open. Filter only applies to picker UI.
- **v0.12.175 + v0.12.176 changes retained** as defense-in-depth: `buildProviderModels` still returns `VISIBLE_OPENCLAW_MODELS`, and `index.ts` still writes `VISIBLE_OPENCLAW_MODELS` to `cfg.models.providers.blockrun.models`. Even though the picker filter is allowlist-driven, keeping these aligned costs nothing.

---

## v0.12.176 — May 2, 2026

- **Picker filter v0.12.175 didn't actually take effect.** Root cause: `src/index.ts` independently writes `cfg.models.providers.blockrun.models` at plugin startup (lines 293, 331, 1582), and it referenced the **unfiltered** `OPENCLAW_MODELS` (~175 entries) — so on every plugin activate it overwrote any pruned array with the full list, completely bypassing the v0.12.175 fix at `buildProviderModels`. Users updating to v0.12.175 still saw 50–58+ entries because `index.ts` re-injected the full set right after my filter ran.
- **Fix**: `src/index.ts` now imports `VISIBLE_OPENCLAW_MODELS` and writes that to `cfg.models.providers.blockrun.models` at all three injection points (provider config injection, validation refresh, runtime port re-injection). The validation logic also gained a "stale superset" check — if the on-disk array contains IDs NOT in `VISIBLE_OPENCLAW_MODELS`, it triggers a rewrite to actively shrink the array (was previously additive-only). This means existing users with stale 159+ entry arrays get their picker auto-pruned on first plugin activate after upgrading.
- **No registry, alias, or routing changes.** `OPENCLAW_MODELS` (full set) remains the resolution layer for proxy routing and alias matching; only the picker-advertisement layer (`provider.models` getter + `index.ts` writes) is filtered.

## v0.12.175 — May 2, 2026

- **Picker filter actually works now.** v0.12.173's `top-models.json` trim was supposed to slim the OpenClaw `/model` picker but didn't, because the picker reads from `cfg.models.providers.blockrun.models` — populated by ClawRouter's `provider.models` getter (`src/provider.ts:43`) → `buildProviderModels()` (`src/models.ts:1163`) — which returned the FULL `OPENCLAW_MODELS` array (~175 entries: 68 BLOCKRUN_MODELS + 107 ALIAS_MODELS). `top-models.json` only drove `agents.defaults.models` (a separate allowlist that controls "which models can be set as default", NOT what shows in the picker). Net effect for users on v0.12.173/v0.12.174: their picker still showed 50–58+ entries including long-retired models (`gpt-5.2`, `gpt-4.1`, `o1`, `o1-mini`, `o3-mini`, `nvidia/kimi-k2.5`, `xai/grok-2-vision`, `free/nemotron-ultra-253b`, etc.).
- **Fix**: `buildProviderModels` now filters `OPENCLAW_MODELS` through a `TOP_MODELS_SET` derived from `src/top-models.json`. Picker drops to ~38 visible entries on next OpenClaw refresh of the provider models. New `VISIBLE_OPENCLAW_MODELS` export in `src/models.ts` is the canonical "what the picker advertises" list.
- **/v1/models HTTP endpoint deliberately unchanged** — still returns the full ~175-entry list for API-level discovery (per Your Majesty's original v0.12.173 intent: "hide from list, but still callable"). Direct ID + alias resolution unaffected; router fallbacks unaffected; proxy routing unaffected.
- **Migration note for existing users**: OpenClaw merges, never deletes, from `cfg.models.providers.blockrun.models`. So users who installed v0.12.174 or earlier still have their old 159-entry array on disk; they'll need either a fresh OpenClaw plugin re-install (which re-reads `provider.models`) or manual openclaw.json cleanup. Future install/update scripts should add a prune step here, similar to the existing `agents.defaults.models` prune — tracked as a follow-up.

---

## v0.12.174 — May 2, 2026

- **`profile=auto` and `profile=agentic` MEDIUM-tier primary swapped from Kimi K2.5 → K2.6.** Per-call cost on these MEDIUM routes goes from $0.60/$3.00 → $0.95/$4.00 — that's **+58% on input tokens, +33% on output tokens** for default-profile users whose classifier returns MEDIUM. The decision deliberately reverses v0.12.170's "tier primaries unchanged pending K2.6 retention/IQ data" stance. The trigger: BlockRun hid K2.5 from its public UI on 2026-04-28 (commit `bfbdedf`) and we hid it from ClawRouter's picker in v0.12.173, so the trajectory toward server-side K2.5 retirement is clear. Promoting K2.6 now is future-proofing — if BlockRun pulls K2.5 server-side later, every MEDIUM call would otherwise 400 → fallback-second-choice silently, which is harder to debug than a clean primary that is already on the still-supported model.
- **Cost-stability opt-out**: users who prefer K2.5's pricing can pin `model: "moonshot/kimi-k2.5"` directly (or use the `kimi-k2.5` alias). K2.5 stays in `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`, the alias map, and is now wired in as the **first fallback** in both `autoTiers.MEDIUM` and `agenticTiers.MEDIUM` chains — so even on the auto path, if K2.6 has an infra hiccup the next attempt is K2.5 (same model, same cost as the v0.12.173 default). Profiles `eco` and `premium` are unaffected (eco MEDIUM = `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, premium SIMPLE was already K2.6).
- **Registry, picker, and other tier primaries unchanged.** Both Kimi versions remain in `src/models.ts`, `src/top-models.json` is identical to v0.12.173, and no other auto/agentic/eco/premium primaries moved. The two known "hidden but still primary" inconsistencies (`autoTiers.SIMPLE` = `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, `agenticTiers.SIMPLE` = `openai/gpt-4o-mini`) are tracked but deferred — they don't have the same urgency signal (BlockRun hasn't pulled them from its UI).

---

## v0.12.173 — May 2, 2026

- **Picker decluttered: 12 superseded long-tail models hidden from OpenClaw `/model` UI.** `src/top-models.json` trimmed from 50 → 38 entries. Hidden: `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5`, `openai/gpt-5.3`, `openai/gpt-5-mini`, `openai/gpt-5-nano`, `openai/gpt-4o`, `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `openai/o3`, `openai/o4-mini`, `google/gemini-2.5-pro`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, `moonshot/kimi-k2.5`. Picker count drops from "55 available" to ~43 once users run `clawrouter update` or reinstall.
- **No callability regression and no fallback impact.** This is a UX-only change: `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` registry, `MODEL_ALIASES`, and `src/router/config.ts` fallback chains are all untouched. Direct calls (`model: "openai/gpt-4o"`) and aliases (`gpt`, `gpt4`, `mini`, `o3`, `gemini`, `flash`, `kimi-k2.5`, `nvidia/kimi-k2.5`, `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`, `minimax-m2.5`) continue to resolve and route normally. The `/v1/models` HTTP endpoint still advertises all 175 entries (registry + aliases) for API-level model discovery — only the OpenClaw picker is filtered.
- **`openai/gpt-5.3-codex` deliberately kept visible.** The codex variant is treated as a distinct developer-targeted entry and stays in the picker.
- **`minimax/minimax-m2.5` already absent** from `top-models.json` (only `minimax/minimax-m2.7` was listed); no action needed and the `minimax-m2.5` alias still works.

---

## v0.12.171 — Apr 29, 2026

- **Three new free NVIDIA-hosted models added.** BlockRun refreshed the free catalog on 2026-04-29 with three additions, all wired into ClawRouter as `free/`-prefixed entries:
  - `free/deepseek-v4-pro` — 1.6T MoE / 49B active, 1M context, MMLU-Pro 87.5, GPQA 90.1, SWE-bench 80.6, LiveCodeBench 93.5. NIM ~150 tok/s on Blackwell. Strongest free reasoning model.
  - `free/deepseek-v4-flash` — 284B / 13B active MoE, 1M context, ~5x faster than v4-pro. Strong on chat/summarization (MMLU-Pro 86.2). Weaker factual recall (SimpleQA 34% vs Pro's 58%) — pick v4-pro for fact-heavy agentic loops.
  - `free/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning` — 31B / 3.2B active MoE, 256K context. First vision-capable free model in the catalog. Accepts text, images, video (up to 2min), audio (up to 1hr). ChartQA 90.3, DocVQA 95.6, MMMU 70.8.
- **`free/deepseek-v3.2` phased out** in favor of `free/deepseek-v4-pro` (strict-superset replacement: same family, larger context, higher benchmarks). Removed from `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`, `FREE_MODELS` set, `top-models.json` picker, README pricing table, and SKILL.md model list. Aliases kept and redirected: `nvidia/deepseek-v3.2`, `free/deepseek-v3.2`, and `deepseek-free` now all resolve to `free/deepseek-v4-pro` so existing pins continue to work and silently get the upgrade.
- **`gpt-oss-120b` / `gpt-oss-20b` deliberately kept as defaults** despite BlockRun's 2026-04-28 retirement (`available:false` server-side). Heavy user demand outweighs the source-of-truth alignment for these specific IDs — `free` / `nvidia` / `gpt-120b` / `gpt-20b` aliases all still resolve to `free/gpt-oss-120b` (or 20b), `FREE_MODEL` constant still points at `free/gpt-oss-120b`, and `ecoTiers.SIMPLE` primary stays unchanged. ClawRouter's existing fallback-chain logic handles any 400 ("Model not available") from BlockRun by trying the next chain entry, so failures degrade gracefully rather than break user workflows.
- **New shorthand aliases for the additions:** `deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, `v4-pro`, `v4-flash`, `nemotron-omni`, `nano-omni`, `vision-free` — chosen to mirror BlockRun's bare-name aliases at `route.ts:639-640` plus a `vision-free` discovery shortcut for the new vision-capable model.
- **`ecoTiers.SIMPLE` fallback chain extended** with the three new free models (mistral-small, deepseek-v4-flash, qwen3-next) inserted before the paid Gemini fallbacks, so eco-profile users get more all-free chain depth before paid models kick in. Primary is unchanged (`free/gpt-oss-120b`).
- **Provider routing safety note.** BlockRun's `NVIDIA_MODEL_MAP` in `src/lib/ai-providers.ts:2094-2111` does NOT have explicit entries for the 3 new models, but `callOpenAICompatible` falls through to the bare model name (`modelMap[k] || k`), so ClawRouter sending `nvidia/deepseek-v4-pro` reaches NVIDIA NIM as bare `deepseek-v4-pro` — which is what NIM expects. Documented in the BLOCKRUN_MODELS comment block in `src/models.ts`. If BlockRun later adds explicit map entries with different upstream names, this side needs no change.
- **Net free-model count: 8 → 10** (8 originals + 3 added - 1 phased out). README badge, tagline, "Quick Start" sections, and SKILL.md description all updated to reflect "10 free NVIDIA models". Pricing table in README adds three new rows in benchmark order.
- **Test fixtures.** `src/router/strategy.test.ts` `MODEL_PRICING` map gains entries for the 3 new free models. No assertion changes anywhere else — gpt-oss-120b stays the asserted default in `src/exclude-models.test.ts`, `src/models.test.ts`, `test/fallback.ts`, and `test/integration/exclude-models.test.ts`.

---

## v0.12.170 — Apr 29, 2026

- **Bare `kimi` / `moonshot` aliases now resolve to Kimi K2.6.** BlockRun hid Kimi K2.5 from its public model UI on 2026-04-28 (commit `bfbdedf`) and now features K2.6 as the Moonshot flagship. ClawRouter's local alias map followed the old direction and still pointed `kimi` and `moonshot` at K2.5, which created a quiet drift from the source-of-truth registry: agents asking for "kimi" got the previous-gen model while BlockRun's homepage advertised K2.6. The aliases now resolve to `moonshot/kimi-k2.6` and a new bare `kimi-k2` alias is added for the same target. Users who explicitly pinned `kimi-k2.5` continue to get K2.5 — the explicit pin is preserved as a cost-stability opt-in ($0.60/$3.00 vs K2.6's $0.95/$4.00). NVIDIA-hosted K2.5 (retired 2026-04-21) still redirects to `moonshot/kimi-k2.5`.
- **Routing tier primaries deliberately unchanged.** `autoTiers.MEDIUM` and `agenticTiers.MEDIUM` continue to anchor on `moonshot/kimi-k2.5`. Promoting them to K2.6 would silently raise per-call cost +58% on input / +33% on output for every default user — that's a separate decision tracked outside this release, ideally with measured retention/IQ data on K2.6 vs K2.5. `premiumTiers.SIMPLE` was already `moonshot/kimi-k2.6` and is unchanged. Net effect: behavior shift is opt-in via the `kimi` alias / `kimi-k2` shorthand, not forced through default routing.
- **Doc and test fixture refresh.** README's profile-overview table now shows `kimi-k2.6` in the PREMIUM column (matching `docs/routing-profiles.md` and `src/router/config.ts:1134`). `src/router/strategy.test.ts` gains a K2.6 pricing fixture so cost-calc tests stay honest if K2.6 ever appears in test scenarios. `src/proxy.models-endpoint.test.ts` now asserts both `kimi-k2.6` and `moonshot/kimi-k2.6` are discoverable through the `/models` endpoint. `test/fallback.ts`'s "Unknown model" example list leads with `moonshot/kimi-k2.6`.

---

## v0.12.169 — Apr 28, 2026

- **Synthesize structured `tool_calls` from XML/text formats some models emit in `content`.** Earlier tool-call hardening (v0.12.165, v0.12.166) handled the case where upstream returned a structured `tool_calls` array (or signaled `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`) and the model also leaked planning prose into `content`. This release closes a third gap where upstream returns _no_ structured tool calls at all and the model's actual tool invocations live as XML/text inside `content` — typical when a downstream client (OpenClaw is the visible offender) prompt-engineers tool instructions instead of sending a structured `tools[]` schema, so the model dutifully honors the prompt format and emits the call as text. Two formats observed in the wild are now recognized and converted to OpenAI-shaped `tool_calls`:
  - **OpenClaw-style** — `<tool_call>NAME<arg_key>K1</arg_key><arg_value>V1</arg_value>...<arg_key>Kn</arg_key><arg_value>Vn</arg_value></tool_call>`. Requires at least one `arg_key`/`arg_value` pair so prose like `<tool_call>name</tool_call>` in documentation does not mis-fire. Surfaced via a real ClawRouter→OpenClaw session where the agent emitted six identical `<tool_call>web_search<arg_key>...</arg_key>...` blocks in 60 seconds, none executed, then hallucinated "I need a Brave API key" as the failure explanation.
  - **Anthropic-style** — `<function_calls><invoke name="NAME"><parameter name="K">V</parameter>...</invoke></function_calls>`. Reproduction confirmed Moonshot Kimi K2.6 emits this format when given prompt-engineered tool instructions without a structured `tools[]` schema.
  - Values are best-effort coerced via `JSON.parse` so `<arg_value>5</arg_value>` becomes `5` (number) and `<arg_value>true</arg_value>` becomes `true` (boolean); strings that don't parse stay as strings. Synthesized IDs are OpenAI-shaped (`call_<base64url>`).
  - Wired into both response paths: the SSE conversion path (`src/proxy.ts:5081+`) and the non-streaming JSON path (`src/proxy.ts:5325+`). When extraction succeeds, `content` is blanked, `message.tool_calls` is populated, and `finish_reason` flips to `"tool_calls"` — matching exactly the shape downstream tool executors already handle from the v0.12.165/166 paths.
  - New module `src/textual-tool-calls.ts` plus `src/textual-tool-calls.test.ts` (13 unit tests) and four new integration tests in `src/proxy.tool-forwarding.test.ts` covering OpenClaw format / non-streaming, OpenClaw format / SSE, Anthropic format / non-streaming, and a negative test (plain prose passes through unchanged with `finish_reason: "stop"`).
- **`/model` picker allowlist now lives in `src/top-models.json`** (single source of truth, loaded by `src/top-models.ts`). Previously `injectModelsConfig()` in `src/index.ts` carried a literal array that drifted from the install scripts' `TOP_MODELS` (which carry their own copies in `scripts/reinstall.sh` + `scripts/update.sh`). The JSON file is the version anyone actually edits going forward; both runtime (`src/index.ts`) and the test suite (`src/top-models.test.ts`) read from it. The install scripts still carry their own embedded copies because they run before npm dependencies are resolved — but now there's one canonical list to copy from when adding a new model.
- **Alias adds.** `br-sonnet` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` (matching the existing `br-` partner shorthand pattern), and `gpt5` now resolves to `openai/gpt-5.5` instead of `openai/gpt-5.4` (following v0.12.167's GPT-5.5 promotion as BlockRun's newest visible flagship).

---

## v0.12.168 — Apr 25, 2026

- **Propagate `openai/gpt-5.5` everywhere it should appear.** v0.12.167 added the model to `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`, the `gpt-5.5` alias, and the install-script `TOP_MODELS` allowlist — but every other place ClawRouter advertises a flagship still pointed at `gpt-5.4`. This release closes the gap so 5.5 is a first-class citizen across routing, the picker, marketing, and the OpenClaw skill page.
  - **`src/router/config.ts` — three fallback-chain insertions, no primary changes.** `openai/gpt-5.5` slots in immediately before `openai/gpt-5.4` in `auto.COMPLEX.fallback`, `premiumTiers.COMPLEX.fallback`, and `agenticTiers.COMPLEX.fallback`. Both stay reachable; 5.5 gets preference when the chain reaches OpenAI. Comments updated so 5.5 is "newest flagship — 1M+ ctx, native agent + computer use" and 5.4 is "previous flagship — benchmarked at 6,213ms, IQ 57". Tier primaries are unchanged: promoting 5.5 to a primary slot needs measured latency/IQ data, which we don't have yet — that's a separate decision tracked outside this release.
  - **`src/index.ts` — `/model` picker allowlist updated.** `src/index.ts` carries its own copy of `TOP_MODELS` (separate from the install scripts' identical-but-distinct list — both populate the OpenClaw allowlist depending on install path). Added `openai/gpt-5.5` and `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5` (also missed in v0.12.167's `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` add for opus-4.5), and replaced the now-deprecated `minimax/minimax-m2.5` with `minimax/minimax-m2.7` so the picker matches the deprecation we landed yesterday.
  - **`README.md` — Premium Models pricing table.** Added the `openai/gpt-5.5` row at $5.00/$30.00 per 1M tokens (~$0.0175 per 0.5K-in-0.5K-out request), 1M context, full feature set. Placed between `claude-opus-4.6` ($0.0150) and `o1` ($0.0375) so the table stays sorted by approximate $/request.
  - **`skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` — model list line.** The "55+ models including..." line now leads `gpt-5.5, gpt-5.4, ...` and includes `claude-opus-4.5` alongside 4.7/4.6.
- **Files deliberately not touched:** `docs/smart-llm-router-14-dimension-classifier.md` and `docs/llm-router-benchmark-46-models-sub-1ms-routing.md` are frozen benchmark archives — adding 5.5 to a benchmark table without measured numbers would falsify the document. The `posts/*.md` marketing content is similarly point-in-time. Those will be refreshed if/when 5.5 gets benchmarked.

---

## v0.12.167 — Apr 24, 2026

- **Realign the model registry to BlockRun source-of-truth.** Audit found three drifts where ClawRouter's `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` table didn't match what `blockrun/src/lib/models.ts` actually exposes. The server is the source of truth for which models exist and what they cost; the proxy's local view should mirror that 1:1 so cost estimation, the `/model` picker, and routing tier selection all see the same world the server does.
  - **Add `openai/gpt-5.5`.** BlockRun's newest visible OpenAI flagship — first fully retrained base since GPT-4.5, 1M+ context, 128K output, native agent + computer use. Pricing $5/$30 per 1M tokens. Added to `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`, the `gpt-5.5` alias, and the `TOP_MODELS` allowlist in both install scripts. Routing tiers in `src/router/config.ts` continue to anchor on `gpt-5.4` because that's what's benchmarked; users can pin `5.5` explicitly. Routing change is a separate decision.
  - **Add `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5` as a distinct model.** Previously ClawRouter's `MODEL_ALIASES` silently rewrote `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5` to `4.7`, making 4.5 unreachable through ClawRouter even though BlockRun lists it as a separate visible model with its own pricing and 200K context (vs 4.6/4.7's 1M). Removed the alias, added 4.5 to `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` with its real 200K/32K shape, and added an `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5` (dashed) alias for the slug variant. Test in `src/models.test.ts` was codifying the old upgrade-to-4.7 behavior — flipped to assert the pin is preserved end-to-end.
  - **Mark `minimax/minimax-m2.5` deprecated → fallback `minimax/minimax-m2.7`.** BlockRun retired m2.5 entirely (only m2.7 is in their `MODELS` table). ClawRouter still listed both; m2.5 now flips to `deprecated: true` with the m2.7 fallback so existing pins keep working.
  - **`scripts/reinstall.sh` + `scripts/update.sh`:** drop `minimax/minimax-m2.5` from the `TOP_MODELS` picker allowlist (still reachable, just hidden from the picker) and add `openai/gpt-5.5` + `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5`.

---

## v0.12.166 — Apr 24, 2026

- **Tool-call planning prose suppressed even when `finish_reason` is the only signal (thanks @0xCheetah1, #162).** Follow-up to v0.12.165's #161 fix. Live Telegram/OpenClaw testing caught one more shape the planning-prose leak could wriggle through: some upstreams (Moonshot Kimi K2.6 again) mark a turn with `finish_reason: "tool_calls"` without exposing `message.tool_calls` / `delta.tool_calls` at the same inspection point. The #161 gate (`toolCalls.length > 0`) saw no array and let the prose through. The gate is now `endsWithToolCalls || toolCalls.length > 0` — applied consistently across the non-streaming JSON path and the SSE emission path, plus the finish-reason override in the SSE terminal chunk. Two new regression tests in `src/proxy.tool-forwarding.test.ts` — one per response shape — lock the behavior in: a response with `finish_reason: "tool_calls"` and no tool_calls array has its `content` blanked and the `tool_calls` finish_reason preserved. User-visible impact: fewer "I should look up X before replying" preambles sneaking into agent chat surfaces for turns that are supposed to be pure tool invocations.

---

## v0.12.165 — Apr 24, 2026

- **Tool-call planning prose no longer leaks to chat surfaces (thanks @0xCheetah1, #161).** Some OpenAI-compatible providers — Moonshot's Kimi K2.6 was the visible offender through OpenClaw Telegram — return `{ content: "The user wants the current time. I should call get_current_time with Chicago.", tool_calls: [...] }`. Tool execution only needs `tool_calls`; the `content` field is internal planning that the upstream should have hidden behind a `<think>` tag but didn't. ClawRouter now suppresses `content` whenever `tool_calls.length > 0`, in both the non-streaming JSON response path and the SSE-conversion path that clients like OpenClaw hit with `stream: true`. Tool execution is unaffected; only the user-visible planning prose goes away. Covered by two regression tests in `src/proxy.tool-forwarding.test.ts` (one per response shape).
- **Plugin restart loop killed.** `injectModelsConfig()` in `src/index.ts` writes ClawRouter-owned keys into `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` on every plugin load. OpenClaw's config watcher has a catch-all rule — any change with no matching plugin-declared prefix triggers a full gateway restart — so `mcp.servers.blockrun` writes kept ping-ponging the gateway. The plugin definition now exposes `reload: { noopPrefixes: ["mcp.servers.blockrun"] }` (new optional field on `OpenClawPluginDefinition`) to tell OpenClaw's loader that ClawRouter self-manages that prefix. Silently ignored on OpenClaw runtimes that predate the `reload` field.
- **Dedup + response cache now isolate streaming and non-streaming callers.** Discovered while adding the SSE regression test for the tool-call fix: a `stream: true` request that followed an identical-body `stream: false` request was getting `content-type: application/json` instead of `text/event-stream`. Two compounding bugs. ClawRouter rewrites `parsed.stream = false` before the upstream call (BlockRun API doesn't support streaming), and both `RequestDeduplicator.hash(body)` and `ResponseCache.generateKey(body)` ran AFTER that rewrite — so a `stream:true` and `stream:false` request hashed identically. Worse, `response-cache.ts`'s `normalizeForCache` explicitly stripped `stream` from the key with the comment "we handle streaming separately" (it never did). Fix: (1) prefix both `dedupKey` and `cacheKey` in `src/proxy.ts` with the original `isStreaming` intent (`"sse:"` vs `"json:"`), so the two shapes never share a cache slot; (2) stop stripping `stream` in `normalizeForCache`. Latent bug — real-world impact was small because the exact scenario (identical body, different stream flag, within 30s/10min TTL) is rare in practice — but a correctness bug nonetheless. Regression test added (`isolates dedup cache between streaming and non-streaming requests with identical bodies`); the existing `response-cache.test.ts` expectation was inverted (it was codifying the broken behavior).

---

## v0.12.164 — Apr 23, 2026

- **Video generation switched to async submit + poll (tracks BlockRun server commit 654cd35).** The server-side `/v1/videos/generations` endpoint no longer blocks for the full 60–180s upstream generation — POST now returns `202 { id, poll_url }` in ~3–20s, and a separate GET on the `poll_url` (same x-payment header) returns `202` while the job is queued/in_progress and `200` with the final video on completion. Server settles only on the first completed poll, so upstream failure or caller disconnect = zero USDC charged. ClawRouter's proxy handler in `src/proxy.ts` now collapses this back into a single blocking POST for the client: submit upstream, poll the `poll_url` every 5s (initial 3s grace) up to a 5-min deadline, then backup + serve locally as before. Legacy sync-shaped server responses still work — the handler checks for `poll_url` before switching to the poll loop. Client-side timeouts bumped: `buildVideoGenerationProvider.timeoutMs` 200s → 330s; `/videogen` slash 200s → 330s; both sit above the 5-min internal poll deadline so the last `data[0].url` finishes streaming back. User-facing impact: same blocking POST as before, but Cloudflare's 100s edge timeout no longer kills long-running Seedance 2.0 jobs.

- **Image/video plumbing parity — four exposure surfaces now match the backend.** The BlockRun server has supported 8 image models (DALL-E 3, GPT Image 1, Nano Banana / Pro, Flux 1.1 Pro, Grok Imagine / Pro, CogView-4) and 4 video models (Grok Imagine, Seedance 1.5 Pro / 2.0 Fast / 2.0) since v0.12.162, but the ClawRouter client exposed them inconsistently:
  - **`buildImageGenerationProvider` in `src/index.ts` only advertised 4 image models.** OpenClaw's native image picker couldn't see Flux, Grok Imagine (×2), or CogView-4 — the only way to hit them was raw curl with an explicit `model` field. The `models` array now lists all 8; defaultModel switched from `openai/gpt-image-1` to `google/nano-banana` (cheapest general-purpose default); `capabilities.geometry.sizes` adds CogView-4's 512x512, 768x768, 768x1344, 1344x768, 1440x1440 sizes; `capabilities.edit.enabled` flipped to `true` so OpenClaw's edit UI surfaces gpt-image-1's `/v1/images/image2image` path.
  - **`MODEL_ALIASES` in `src/models.ts` had zero image/video shortcuts.** All 140+ aliases were LLM chat models. Added 17 new aliases so `resolveModelAlias("dalle")` → `openai/dall-e-3`, `"flux"` → `black-forest/flux-1.1-pro`, `"seedance"` → `bytedance/seedance-1.5-pro`, plus `banana`, `banana-pro`, `nano-banana-pro`, `gpt-image`, `flux-pro`, `grok-imagine` / `-pro`, `grok-video`, `cogview`, `seedance-1.5`, `seedance-2`, `seedance-2-fast`.
  - **`/imagegen` and `/videogen` slash commands now actually exist.** README documented `/imagegen a dog dancing on the beach` as if it worked, but no such command was ever registered — it was silent drift from the aspirational README. Both commands now register via `api.registerCommand`, accept `--model=<alias>`, `--size=WxH`, `--n=<int>`, `--duration=<5|8|10>` flags (parsed by a shared `parseGenArgs` helper), resolve aliases through `resolveModelAlias`, POST to the proxy's `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/videos/generations` endpoints, and return inline markdown (`![image](http://localhost:8402/images/...)`) or video URLs. 402 responses surface as "top up with `/wallet`" hints; video timeout is 200s to cover upstream polling. `/img2img` remains README-only for now — will land in a follow-up.
  - **Partner framework now includes image/video as LLM-callable tools.** Added three new `PartnerServiceDefinition` entries in `src/partners/registry.ts` — `image_generation`, `image_edit`, `video_generation` — so the existing `buildPartnerTools` → `api.registerTool` pipeline surfaces them as `blockrun_image_generation`, `blockrun_image_edit`, `blockrun_video_generation` tools. Agents can now tool-call image/video from chat without the skill layer guessing at raw HTTP shapes.
- **Dropped the Twitter/X user-lookup partner.** We no longer run X data as a product surface. Removed `x_users_lookup` from `PARTNER_SERVICES`, deleted the `skills/x-api/` skill directory, and stripped `x|` from the `/v1/(?:x|partner|pm|...)/` paid-route regex in `src/proxy.ts` (so `/v1/x/*` no longer short-circuits to the partner proxy — it now falls through to the usual chat-completion path or 404s cleanly). Server-side `/v1/x/*` endpoints are still live at `blockrun.ai/api` for any existing integrations; only the client wiring is retired.
- **`/partners` + `clawrouter partners` CLI output compressed ~4×.** Previously 6 lines per service (name, full agent-facing description, tool name, method, pricing block, blank) × 17 services ≈ 100 lines of wall-of-text, which is what @vicky was calling out as "读不了" (unreadable). `PartnerServiceDefinition` gained two fields — `category` ("Prediction markets" / "Market data" / "Image & Video") and `shortDescription` (≤ 40 chars) — driving a new grouped, column-aligned one-liner per tool. The long `description` field stays intact for the LLM-facing JSON Schema (agents still see "Call this ONLY when..." guidance). Output is now ~25 lines, one screen.

## v0.12.163 — Apr 23, 2026

- **README leads with the free tier.** Post-v0.12.160 the product story changed — 8 NVIDIA models free forever, no wallet required to start — but the README still opened "fund your wallet" as step 2 of Quick Start and buried the free tier in a single line at the bottom. Rewrites so the free tier is the hook, not a footnote: hero tagline adds "8 models free, no crypto required. No signup. No API key. No credit card." plus a 🆓 shields.io badge; the "Why ClawRouter exists" list opens with "Starts at $0"; the comparison-vs-others table adds a "Free tier" row showing ClawRouter's "8 models, no signup" against OpenRouter's rate limits and LiteLLM/Martian/Portkey's "no"; Quick Start gets a "No wallet? 8 models work free out of the box" callout and reframes step 2 as optional; routing-profiles table adds `/model free` at 100% savings; the Costs section lists the current 8 free model IDs by name (was a stale 11-model list referencing the retired Nemotron Ultra / Mistral Large / Devstral). This release is README-only — code is identical to v0.12.162 — version bump exists so the updated marketing reaches the npmjs.com package page and the clawhub marketplace listing.

---

## v0.12.162 — Apr 23, 2026

- **ByteDance Seedance video models wired into the client.** BlockRun server has exposed three Seedance models since late April — `bytedance/seedance-1.5-pro` ($0.03/sec), `bytedance/seedance-2.0-fast` ($0.15/sec, ~60–80s gen time), and `bytedance/seedance-2.0` Pro ($0.30/sec) — all 720p, text-to-video + image-to-video, 5s default and up to 10s. The `/v1/videos/generations` proxy passthrough in `src/proxy.ts` already forwarded any `model` value untouched, so **actual USDC charges were always correct** (server dictates the amount in its 402 response and `payment-preauth.ts` caches the server-sent `PaymentRequired`, not a local estimate — charges never depended on ClawRouter's local pricing table). Three client-side gaps were fixed anyway:
  - **Usage telemetry was wrong for Seedance.** `estimateVideoCost` in `src/proxy.ts` only knew `xai/grok-imagine-video`, so every Seedance request logged `$0.42/clip` to `logUsage` regardless of what the user was actually billed — skewing `/usage` output, savings %, and journal cost fields. `VIDEO_PRICING` now carries all four models at real server rates.
  - **OpenClaw's native video UI only saw one model.** `buildVideoGenerationProvider` in `src/index.ts` advertised `models: ["xai/grok-imagine-video"]`, so users of the UI picker couldn't pick Seedance at all; the only path was raw curl with an explicit `model` field. The `models` array now lists all four, and provider capabilities widen to `maxDurationSeconds: 10` / `supportedDurationSeconds: [5, 8, 10]` to cover both vendors' ranges (server still validates per-model `maxDurationSeconds`, so invalid combos return a clean 400).
  - **README docs only mentioned Grok.** Video-generation section now lists all four models in the table, swaps the curl example to `bytedance/seedance-2.0-fast` (sweet-spot price/quality), and makes the upstream-polling note vendor-neutral instead of xAI-specific.
- **Docs: fixed proxy port in free-models guide.** Thanks to @Bortlesboat (#160) for catching `4402` → `8402` typos in `docs/11-free-ai-models-zero-cost-blockrun.md`. The rest of the repo, `src/config.ts` (`DEFAULT_PORT = 8402`), and all other docs have always said 8402; that one guide was sending new users at the wrong local port.

---

## v0.12.161 — Apr 22, 2026

- **De-Gemini the Anthropic-primary fallback chains.** When Anthropic hiccups (503s, capacity), Gemini's own "high demand" 503s correlate with the same events — agents fall back from Claude to Gemini together, both overloaded. Reordered `src/router/config.ts` fallback arrays in the two places Anthropic sits primary: `premiumTiers.COMPLEX` (claude-opus-4.7 primary) and `agenticTiers.COMPLEX` (claude-sonnet-4.6 primary). New order: in-family Anthropic hot swap (opus-4.6 / sonnet-4.6) → xAI Grok (independent infra, strong on complex + tool use) → Moonshot Kimi K2.6 / K2.5 (separate Moonshot infra) → OpenAI flagship (slow but reliable) → DeepSeek (cheap reliable) → `free/qwen3-coder-480b` (NVIDIA free ultimate backstop). Gemini removed entirely from both chains. Other Anthropic-primary tiers (`premiumTiers.REASONING`, `agenticTiers.REASONING`) already had no Gemini and were not touched.

---

## v0.12.160 — Apr 21, 2026

- **Free-tier catalog realigned with BlockRun server (13 → 8 NVIDIA free models).** BlockRun retired five NVIDIA free models on 2026-04-21 (`nemotron-ultra-253b`, `nemotron-3-super-120b`, `nemotron-super-49b`, `mistral-large-3-675b`, `devstral-2-123b`) and introduced two new ones benchmark-validated at 114–116 tok/s (`qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking` — fastest free reasoning; `mistral-small-4-119b` — fastest free chat). ClawRouter now exposes the same 8 visible free models: `gpt-oss-120b`, `gpt-oss-20b`, `deepseek-v3.2`, `qwen3-coder-480b`, `glm-4.7`, `llama-4-maverick`, `qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking`, `mistral-small-4-119b`. Retired IDs still resolve locally via `MODEL_ALIASES` redirects to successors (`free/nemotron-*` → `free/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking`, `free/mistral-large-3-675b` → `free/mistral-small-4-119b`, `free/devstral-2-123b` → `free/qwen3-coder-480b`), matching server-side behavior so stale user configs keep working. Touched: `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` + `MODEL_ALIASES` in `src/models.ts`, `FREE_MODELS` set in `src/proxy.ts`, free-model list in `src/index.ts` picker, `MODEL_PRICING` fixture in `src/router/strategy.test.ts`, `scripts/update.sh` + `scripts/reinstall.sh` `TOP_MODELS` + slash-command help, README Budget Models pricing table + Free tier note, skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md description + Available Models section.
- **Kimi K2.5 routing inverted: Moonshot direct is now primary.** NVIDIA-hosted `nvidia/kimi-k2.5` was retired 2026-04-21 (slow throughput) and redirects server-side to `moonshot/kimi-k2.5`. ClawRouter mirrors this: `moonshot/kimi-k2.5` is the primary entry (no deprecation flag, full 16K output), `nvidia/kimi-k2.5` retained but marked `deprecated: true` with `fallbackModel: "moonshot/kimi-k2.5"`. Aliases `kimi` / `moonshot` / `kimi-k2.5` / `nvidia/kimi-k2.5` all resolve to `moonshot/kimi-k2.5`. Router tier configs in `src/router/config.ts` (auto + premium + agentic profiles, 7 occurrences) updated to point at the Moonshot variant.

---

## v0.12.159 — Apr 21, 2026

- **Market data tools** — BlockRun gateway now exposes realtime and historical market data; ClawRouter wires them into OpenClaw as 6 first-class agent tools so the model stops scraping finance sites. Paid ($0.001 via x402, same wallet as LLM calls): `blockrun_stock_price` and `blockrun_stock_history` across **12 global equity markets** (US, HK, JP, KR, UK, DE, FR, NL, IE, LU, CN, CA). Free (no x402 charge): `blockrun_stock_list` (ticker lookup / company-name search), `blockrun_crypto_price` (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD, …), `blockrun_fx_price` (EUR-USD, GBP-USD, JPY-USD, …), `blockrun_commodity_price` (XAU-USD gold, XAG-USD silver, XPT-USD platinum). Tool schemas advertise market codes, session hints (pre/post/on), and bar resolutions (1/5/15/60/240/D/W/M). Path routing extended: the partner-proxy whitelist in `src/proxy.ts` now matches `/v1/(?:x|partner|pm|exa|modal|stocks|usstock|crypto|fx|commodity)/`, routing all new paths through `proxyPaidApiRequest` (payFetch handles 402 when present, passes through 200 for free categories). Tool definitions added in `src/partners/registry.ts`; `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` gains a "Built-in Agent Tools" section listing market data + X intelligence + Polymarket alongside the LLM router.

---

## v0.12.158 — Apr 20, 2026

- **SKILL.md data-flow + key-storage transparency** — second-pass fix for the OpenClaw scanner on clawhub.ai. After v0.12.157 cleared the original scanner concerns (opaque credentials, implied multi-provider keys, no install artifact), a deeper rescan surfaced three new, more nuanced flags: (1) prompts go to blockrun.ai as a data-privacy risk not obvious from a "local router" framing, (2) wallet private-key storage location/encryption undocumented, (3) users may expect strictly-local routing. All three addressed: (a) description frontmatter and body lead reframed as "Hosted-gateway LLM router" + "This is not a local-inference tool" with explicit Ollama pointer for users who need local-only, (b) new **Data Flow** section with ASCII diagram + enumerated sent/not-sent lists + link to https://blockrun.ai/privacy, (c) new **Credentials & Local Key Storage** section documenting config file locations per OS (`~/.config/openclaw`, `~/Library/Application Support/openclaw`, `%APPDATA%\openclaw`), `0600` POSIX permissions, plaintext storage parity with other OpenClaw provider keys, encryption guidance (FileVault/LUKS/BitLocker or burner wallet), and a `src/wallet.ts` source pointer for key-derivation auditing, (d) new **Supply-Chain Integrity** section with `npm pack` verification instructions and tagged-release invariant from the release checklist.

---

## v0.12.157 — Apr 20, 2026

- **SKILL.md credential transparency** — rewrote `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md` to clear the OpenClaw scanner's medium-confidence suspicious verdict on clawhub.ai. Frontmatter now declares `repository: https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter`, `license: MIT`, and a structured `metadata.openclaw.install` array (`kind: node`, `package: @blockrun/clawrouter`, `bins: [clawrouter]`) so the registry entry has an auditable install artifact instead of a bare bash block. Body adds a **Credentials & Data Handling** section fully enumerating what `models.providers.blockrun` stores (`walletKey` / `solanaKey` — auto-generated locally, never transmitted; `gateway` / `routing` — non-sensitive), and explicitly states the plugin does not collect or forward third-party provider API keys (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/DeepSeek/xAI/NVIDIA) — the blockrun.ai gateway owns those relationships and routes on the server side. Addresses the three scanner flags (opaque credential declaration, implied multi-provider credential collection, no install artifact for review) raised against v0.12.156 on https://clawhub.ai/1bcmax/clawrouter.

---

## v0.12.156 — Apr 20, 2026

- **Kimi K2.6 added** — Moonshot's new flagship (`moonshot/kimi-k2.6`, 256K context, vision + reasoning, $0.95 in / $4.00 out per 1M) registered in `BLOCKRUN_MODELS` with `kimi-k2.6` alias. Added to the curated `/model` picker list (`src/index.ts`, `scripts/update.sh`, `scripts/reinstall.sh`), the README pricing table, `docs/routing-profiles.md`, and the AI-agent-facing model catalog in `skills/clawrouter/SKILL.md`. Premium routing tier (`blockrun/premium`) now uses K2.6 as the SIMPLE primary and as a fallback in MEDIUM/COMPLEX, with `nvidia/kimi-k2.5` retained as the first fallback for reliability. The generic `kimi`/`moonshot` aliases still resolve to `nvidia/kimi-k2.5` (matches BlockRun server's `blockrun/kimi` stance); users opt in to K2.6 explicitly via `kimi-k2.6` or `blockrun/premium`.
- **GitHub restored as canonical source** — BlockRunAI GitHub org is back. `package.json` `repository.url`, README badges, CONTRIBUTING clone URL, `openclaw.security.json`, all docs (`anthropic-*`, `clawrouter-cuts-*`, `clawrouter-vs-openrouter`, `11-free-ai-models`, `llm-router-benchmark-*`, `smart-llm-router-14-dimension-classifier`, `subscription-failover`, `troubleshooting`), `skills/release/SKILL.md`, and the `sse-error-format` regression-test comment now point at `github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter`. GitLab mirror (`gitlab.com/blockrunai/ClawRouter`) is kept as a secondary remote for redundancy but is no longer advertised. Metadata + docs only; no runtime/code changes.

---

## v0.12.155 — Apr 18, 2026

- **Docs: video generation endpoint** — README now documents `POST /v1/videos/generations` with `xai/grok-imagine-video` ($0.05/sec, 8s default). The proxy handler, cost estimator (`estimateVideoCost`), and local-file download path were already in place in `proxy.ts`; only the README was missing.
- **Docs: Grok Imagine image models** — README image table now includes `xai/grok-imagine-image` ($0.02) and `xai/grok-imagine-image-pro` ($0.07), already wired into the image pricing map.

---

## v0.12.153 — Apr 16, 2026

- **Claude Opus 4.7 flagship** — BlockRun API has promoted `anthropic/claude-opus-4.7` to flagship (1M context, 128K output, adaptive thinking; $5/$25 per 1M tokens). Added to `BLOCKRUN_MODELS`, now the primary for the `COMPLEX` routing tier across default/premium profiles and the new cost-savings `BASELINE_MODEL_ID`. Aliases: `opus`, `opus-4`, `anthropic/opus`, `anthropic/claude-opus-4`, and `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5` now resolve to 4.7. Explicit 4.6 pins (`opus-4.6`, `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`) still route to 4.6, which the server keeps available. Opus 4.7 is also added to the curated `TOP_MODELS` picker list and `doctor` command. Opus 4.6 ClawRouter metadata updated to match server specs (1M/128K, was stale at 200K/32K).

---

## v0.12.152 — Apr 16, 2026

- **Repository URL fixed** — `package.json` `repository.url` now points at `gitlab.com/blockrunai/ClawRouter`. The previous value (`github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter`) has been dead since the GitHub org was banned 2026-04-15. Metadata-only bump; no code changes.

---

## v0.12.151 — Apr 16, 2026

- **Stop bundling blockrun-mcp** — ClawRouter no longer auto-injects `mcp.servers.blockrun` into `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. The `npx -y @blockrun/mcp@latest` spawns were leaking shell-wrapper + node grandchildren processes on the host (see reports of 70+ orphaned processes accumulating). Removal of the injection call is matched by a one-shot migration that strips any previously managed `mcp.servers.blockrun` entry the next time the gateway starts. User-defined `blockrun` MCP entries are preserved. **Restart your gateway after upgrading** to free any already-leaked processes. Users who still want the MCP bridge can opt in manually: `openclaw mcp add blockrun npx -y @blockrun/mcp@latest`.

---

## v0.12.89 — Mar 30, 2026

- **Predexon tools registered** — 8 Predexon endpoints now registered as real OpenClaw tools (`blockrun_predexon_events`, `blockrun_predexon_leaderboard`, `blockrun_predexon_markets`, `blockrun_predexon_smart_money`, `blockrun_predexon_smart_activity`, `blockrun_predexon_wallet`, `blockrun_predexon_wallet_pnl`, `blockrun_predexon_matching_markets`). Agent will now call these directly instead of falling back to browser scraping.
- **Partner tools GET support** — `tools.ts` execute function now handles GET endpoints with query params and path param substitution (`:wallet`, `:condition_id`, etc.).

---

## v0.12.88 — Mar 30, 2026

- **Skill priority fix** — `predexon` and `x-api` skills now explicitly instruct the agent not to use browser/web_fetch for these data sources, ensuring the structured API is always used over scraping.

---

## v0.12.87 — Mar 30, 2026

- **Predexon skill** — New vendor skill ships with ClawRouter: 39 prediction market endpoints (Polymarket, Kalshi, dFlow, Binance, cross-market matching, wallet analytics, smart money). OpenClaw agents now auto-invoke this skill when users ask about prediction markets, market odds, or smart money positioning.
- **Partner proxy extended** — `/v1/pm/*` paths now route through ClawRouter's partner proxy (same as `/v1/x/*`), enabling automatic x402 payment for all Predexon endpoints via `localhost:8402`.

---

## v0.12.86 — Mar 29, 2026

### Fixed

- **Free model cost logging** — Usage stats incorrectly showed non-zero cost for free models (e.g. `free/gpt-oss-120b` showed $0.001 per request due to the `MIN_PAYMENT_USD` floor in `calculateModelCost`). Free models now log `cost: $0.00`and`savings: 100%`, accurately reflecting that no payment is made.

---

## v0.12.84 — Mar 26, 2026

### Fixed

- **`/doctor` checks correct chain balance** — Previously always checked Base (EVM), showing $0.00 for Solana-funded wallets. Now calls `resolvePaymentChain()` and uses `SolanaBalanceMonitor` when on Solana. Shows active chain label and hints to run `/wallet solana` if balance is empty on Base.
- **Strip thinking tokens from non-streaming responses** — Free models leaked `<think>...</think>` blocks in non-streaming responses. `stripThinkingTokens()` was only applied in the streaming path — now also runs on non-streaming JSON responses.
- **Preserve OpenClaw channels on install/update** — `reinstall.sh` and `update.sh` now backup `~/.openclaw/credentials/` before `openclaw plugins install` and always restore after, preventing WhatsApp/Telegram channel disappearance.

### Added

- **Blog section in README** — 6 blog posts linked from the repo, including "11 Free AI Models, Zero Cost".
- **BRCC ecosystem block** — Replaced SocialClaw with BRCC (BlockRun for Claude Code) in the README ecosystem section.
- **`blockrun.ai/brcc-install` short link** — Redirect for BRCC install script.

---

## v0.12.81 — Mar 25, 2026

### Added

- **11 free models** — GPT-OSS 20B/120B, Nemotron Ultra 253B, Nemotron Super 49B/120B, DeepSeek V3.2, Mistral Large 3, Qwen3 Coder 480B, Devstral 2 123B, GLM 4.7, Llama 4 Maverick. All free, no wallet balance needed.
- **`/model free` alias** — Points to nemotron-ultra-253b (strongest free model). All 11 free models individually selectable via `/model` picker.
- **New model aliases** — `nemotron`, `devstral`, `qwen-coder`, `maverick`, `deepseek-free`, `mistral-free`, `glm-free`, `llama-free`, and more (16 total).

### Fixed

- **Skills not found by OpenClaw agents** — Auto-copies bundled skills (imagegen, x-api, clawrouter) to `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` on plugin registration. Fixes `ENOENT` errors when agents invoke `/imagegen`.
- **Internal `release` skill excluded** — No longer installed to user workspaces.
- **Sync package-lock.json**

---

## v0.12.73 — Mar 24, 2026

### Fixed

- **Skills not found by OpenClaw agents** — Agents tried to read skill files (imagegen, x-api, etc.) from `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` but ClawRouter only bundled them inside the npm package. Now auto-copies all user-facing bundled skills into the workspace directory on plugin registration. Supports `OPENCLAW_PROFILE` for multi-profile setups. Only updates when content changes. Fixes `ENOENT: no such file or directory` errors when agents invoke `/imagegen`.
- **Internal `release` skill excluded** — The release checklist skill is for ClawRouter maintainers only and is no longer installed to user workspaces.
- **Sync package-lock.json** — Lock file was stuck at v0.12.69, now matches package.json.

---

## v0.12.70 — Mar 24, 2026

### Fixed

- **Plugin crash on string model config** — ClawRouter crashed during OpenClaw plugin registration with `TypeError: Cannot create property 'primary' on string 'blockrun/auto'`. This happened when `agents.defaults.model` in the OpenClaw config was a plain string (e.g. `"blockrun/auto"`) instead of the expected object `{ primary: "blockrun/auto" }`. Now auto-converts string/array/non-object model values to the correct object form.

---

## v0.12.67 — Mar 22, 2026

### Fixed

- **Config duplication on update** — `update.sh` and `reinstall.sh` accumulated stale `blockrun/*` model entries in `openclaw.json` on every update because only 2 hardcoded deprecated models were removed. Now performs a full reconciliation: removes any `blockrun/*` entries not in the current `TOP_MODELS` list before adding new ones. Non-blockrun entries are untouched.

---

## v0.12.30 — Mar 9, 2026

- **OpenClaw skills registration** — added `"skills": ["./skills"]` to `openclaw.plugin.json` so OpenClaw actually loads bundled skills (was missing, skills were never active)
- **imagegen skill** — new `skills/imagegen/SKILL.md`: teaches Claude to generate images via `POST /v1/images/generations`, model selection table (nano-banana, banana-pro, dall-e-3, flux), size options, example interactions
- **x-api skill** — new `skills/x-api/SKILL.md`: teaches Claude to look up X/Twitter user profiles via `POST /v1/x/users/lookup`, with pricing table, response schema, and example interactions

---

## v0.12.25 — Mar 8, 2026

- **Image generation docs** — new `docs/image-generation.md` with API reference, curl/TypeScript/Python/OpenAI SDK examples, model pricing table, and `/imagegen` command reference
- **Comprehensive docs refresh** — architecture updated for dual-chain (Base + Solana), configuration updated with all env vars (`CLAWROUTER_SOLANA_RPC_URL`, `CLAWROUTER_WORKER`), troubleshooting updated for USDC-on-Solana funding, CHANGELOG backfilled for v0.11.14–v0.12.24

---

## v0.12.24 — Mar 8, 2026

- **Preserve user-defined blockrun/\* allowlist entries** — `injectModelsConfig()` no longer removes user-added `blockrun/*` allowlist entries on gateway restarts

---

## v0.12.14 — Mar 6, 2026

- **`/chain` command** — persist payment chain selection (Base or Solana) across restarts via `/chain solana` or `/chain base`
- **Update nudge improved** — now shows `npx @blockrun/clawrouter@latest` instead of `curl | bash`
- **Zero balance cache fix** — funded wallets are detected immediately (zero balance never cached)
- **`wallet recover` command** — restore `wallet.key` from BIP-39 mnemonic on a new machine
- **Solana balance retry** — retries once on empty to handle flaky public RPC endpoints
- **Balance cache invalidated at startup** — prevents false free-model fallback after fresh install

---

## v0.12.13 — Mar 5, 2026

- **openai/ prefix routing fix** — virtual profiles (`blockrun/auto`, etc.) now handle `openai/` prefix injected by some clients
- **Body-read timeout increased** — 5-minute timeout for slow reasoning models prevents proxy hangs

---

## v0.12.11 — Mar 5, 2026

- **Server-side update nudge** — 429 responses from BlockRun now surface update hints when running an outdated ClawRouter version
- **Body-read timeout** — prevents proxy from hanging on stalled upstream streams
- **@solana/kit version fix** — pinned to `^5.0.0` to resolve cross-version signing bug causing `transaction_simulation_failed` (#74)
- **`/stats clear` command** — reset usage statistics
- **Gemini 3 models excluded from tool-heavy routing** (#73)
- **GPT-5.4 and GPT-5.4 Pro** — added to model catalog

---

## v0.12.5 — Mar 4, 2026

- **Force agentic tiers on tool presence** — requests with `tools` array always route to agentic-capable models

---

## v0.12.4 — Mar 4, 2026

- **Solana sweep fix** — correctly attaches signers to sweep transaction message (#70)

---

## v0.12.3 — Mar 4, 2026

- **Multi-account sweep** — correctly handles partial reads and JSONL resilience in sweep migration
- **SPL Token Program ID fix** — corrected in Solana sweep transaction

---

## v0.12.0 — Mar 3, 2026

### Solana USDC Payments

Full Solana chain support. Pay with **USDC on Solana** (not SOL) alongside Base (EVM).

- **SLIP-10 Ed25519 derivation** — Solana wallet uses BIP-44 path `m/44'/501'/0'/0'`, compatible with Phantom and other wallets (#69)
- **`SolanaBalanceMonitor`** — reads SPL Token USDC balance; `proxy.ts` selects EVM or Solana monitor based on active chain
- **Solana address shown in `/wallet`** — displays both EVM (`0x...`) and Solana (base58) addresses
- **Health endpoint** — returns Solana address alongside EVM address
- **Pre-auth cache skipped for Solana** — prevents double payment on Solana chain
- **Startup balance uses chain-aware monitor** — fixes EVM-only startup log when Solana is active
- **Chain-aware proxy reuse** — validates payment chain matches on EADDRINUSE path
- **`ethers` peer dep** — added for `@x402/evm` via SIWE compatibility

---

## v0.11.14 — Mar 2, 2026

- **Free model fallback notification** — notifies user when routing to `gpt-oss-120b` due to insufficient USDC balance

---

## v0.11.9 — Mar 2, 2026

- **Top 16 model allowlist** — trimmed from 88 to 16 curated models in `/model` picker (4 routing profiles + 12 popular models)

## v0.11.8 — Mar 2, 2026

- **Populate model allowlist** — populate `agents.defaults.models` with BlockRun models so they appear in `/model` picker

## v0.11.7 — Mar 1, 2026

- **Auto-fix broken allowlist** — `injectModelsConfig()` detects and removes blockrun-only allowlist on every gateway start

## v0.11.6 — Mar 1, 2026

- **Allowlist cleanup in reinstall.sh** — detect and remove blockrun-only allowlist that hid all other models

## v0.11.5 — Mar 1, 2026

- **`clawrouter report` command** — daily/weekly/monthly usage reports via `npx @blockrun/clawrouter report`
- **`clawrouter doctor` command** — AI diagnostics for troubleshooting

## v0.11.4 — Mar 1, 2026

- **catbox.moe image hosting** — `/imagegen` uploads base64 data URIs to catbox.moe (replaces broken telegra.ph)

## v0.11.3 — Mar 1, 2026

- **Image upload for Telegram** — base64 data URIs from Google image models converted to hosted URLs

## v0.11.2 — Feb 28, 2026

## v0.11.0 / v0.11.1 — Feb 28, 2026

### Three-Strike Escalation

Session-level repetition detection: 3 consecutive identical request hashes auto-escalate to the next tier (SIMPLE → MEDIUM → COMPLEX → REASONING). Fixes Kimi K2.5 agentic loop problem without manual model switching.

### `/imagegen` command

Generate images from chat. Calls BlockRun's image generation API with x402 micropayments.

```
/imagegen a cat wearing sunglasses
/imagegen --model dall-e-3 a futuristic city
/imagegen --model banana-pro --size 2048x2048 landscape
```

| Model                        | Shorthand     | Price                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Google Nano Banana (default) | `nano-banana` | $0.05/image            |
| Google Nano Banana Pro       | `banana-pro`  | $0.10/image (up to 4K) |
| OpenAI DALL-E 3              | `dall-e-3`    | $0.04/image            |
| OpenAI GPT Image 1           | `gpt-image`   | $0.02/image            |
| Black Forest Flux 1.1 Pro    | `flux`        | $0.04/image            |

## v0.10.20 / v0.10.21 — Feb 27, 2026

- **Stop hijacking model picker** — removed allowlist injection that hid non-BlockRun models from `/model` picker
- **Silent fallback to free model** — insufficient funds now skips remaining paid models and jumps to the free tier instead of showing payment errors

---

## v0.10.19 — Feb 27, 2026

- **Anthropic array content extraction** — routing now handles `[{type:"text", text:"..."}]` content format (was extracting empty string)
- **Session startup bias fix** — never-downgrade logic: sessions can upgrade tiers but won't lock to the low-complexity startup message tier

---

## v0.10.18 — Feb 26, 2026

- **Session re-pins to fallback** — after provider failure, session updates to the actual model that responded instead of retrying the failing primary every turn

---

## v0.10.16 / v0.10.17 — Feb 26, 2026

- **`/debug` command** — type `/debug <prompt>` to see routing diagnostics (tier, model, scores, session state) with zero API cost
- **Tool-calling model filter** — requests with tool schemas skip incompatible models automatically
- **Session persistence enabled by default** — `deriveSessionId()` hashes first user message; model stays pinned 30 min without client headers
- **baselineCost fix** — hardcoded Opus 4.6 fallback pricing so savings metric always calculates correctly

---

## v0.10.12 – v0.10.15 — Feb 26, 2026

- **Tool call leaking fix** — removed `grok-code-fast-1` from all routing paths (was outputting tool invocations as plain text)
- **Systematic tool-calling guard** — `toolCalling` flag on models; incompatible models filtered from fallback chains
- **Async plugin fix** — `register()` made synchronous; OpenClaw was silently skipping initialization

---

## v0.10.9 — Feb 24, 2026

- **Agentic mode false trigger** — `agenticScore` now scores user prompt only, not system prompt. Coding assistant system prompts no longer force all requests to Sonnet.

---

## v0.10.8 — Feb 24, 2026

- **OpenClaw tool API contract** — fixed `inputSchema` → `parameters`, `execute(args)` → `execute(toolCallId, params)`, and return format

---

## v0.10.7 — Feb 24, 2026

- **Partner tool trigger reliability** — directive tool description so AI calls the tool instead of answering from memory
- **Baseline cost fix** — `BASELINE_MODEL_ID` corrected from `claude-opus-4-5` to `claude-opus-4.6`
- **Wallet corruption safety** — corrupted wallet files throw with recovery instructions instead of silently generating new wallet

---

## v0.10.5 — Feb 22, 2026

- **9-language router** — added ES, PT, KO, AR keywords across all 12 scoring dimensions (was 5 languages)

---

## v0.10.0 — Feb 21, 2026

- **Claude 4.6** — all Claude models updated to newest Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.6
- **7 new models** — total 41 (Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview, Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, o1, o1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, grok-2-vision)
- **5 pricing fixes** — 15-30% better routing from corrected model costs
- **67% cheaper ECO tier** — Flash Lite for MEDIUM/COMPLEX
