# Routing Profiles & Pricing

ClawRouter offers four routing profiles to balance cost vs quality. Prices are in **$/M tokens** (input/output), taken from `src/models.ts` (which mirrors the live BlockRun catalog).

Routing decisions are made by [`@blockrun/router-core`](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/router-core) (Router Core **V3.4**, the constraint-first portfolio router), which ClawRouter inlines at build time and pins by commit SHA. `src/router/index.ts` simply re-exports it. Nothing below calls a network or a second model: classification, eligibility filtering and ranking all run locally in about a quarter of a millisecond.

## How a request is routed

1. **Classify.** A 15-dimension weighted scorer maps the request onto a capability tier — `SIMPLE`, `MEDIUM`, `COMPLEX` or `REASONING` — and a task classifier labels the _shape_ of the work (`chat`, `extraction`, `code_edit`, `code_agent`, `tool_agent`, `tool_agent_parallel`, `debug`, `reasoning`, `reasoning_math`, `long_context`, `vision`, …). Turns that actually need their attached tools switch to the **agentic** tier set automatically.
2. **Filter.** The tier's curated chain (primary + fallbacks, below) is the candidate pool. Every model that cannot satisfy the request is removed **before** scoring: no tool calling on a tool-required turn, no vision on image input, too small a context window, too small a max-output, an incompatible structured-output path, or absent from the live catalog. Being cheap never compensates for failing the contract.
3. **Rank.** Survivors are scored on task quality, capability, estimated cost, speed, reliability and a small curated-order prior. The weights differ per profile (see [Profile weights](#profile-weights)).
4. **Recover.** The full ranked list stays on the decision as `candidates`. The proxy walks it on a timeout or 5xx, so a provider outage costs a retry, not the task.

The tables show each tier's **curated primary** and its fallback chain as configured in router-core. Under the portfolio strategy the primary is the head of the candidate pool and carries the curated-order prior; it is the usual winner, not a guarantee — a request that needs vision or a 1M context can legitimately land on a fallback.

## AUTO (Balanced — Default)

Use `blockrun/auto` (or `/model auto`) for the best quality/price balance.

| Tier      | Primary Model              | Input | Output | Fallback chain (in order)                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SIMPLE    | google/gemini-2.5-flash    | $0.30 | $2.50  | gemini-3-flash-preview → gemini-3.5-flash-lite → deepseek-chat → gemini-3.1-flash-lite → gpt-5.6-luna → gpt-5.4-nano → gemini-2.5-flash-lite → nemotron-3.5-lightning (free)                                       |
| MEDIUM    | google/gemini-3.5-flash    | $1.50 | $9.00  | gemini-3.6-flash → glm-5.3-flash → gpt-5.6-terra → gemini-3-flash-preview → deepseek-chat → gemini-2.5-flash → minimax-m3 → gemini-3.1-flash-lite → gpt-5.6-luna → gemini-2.5-flash-lite                           |
| COMPLEX   | google/gemini-3.1-pro      | $2.00 | $12.00 | gemini-3.6-flash → gemini-3.5-flash → claude-sonnet-5 → grok-4.5 → gemini-2.5-pro → claude-sonnet-4.6 → gpt-5.6-terra → gpt-5.5 → gpt-5.4 → glm-5.3 → kimi-k3 → deepseek-v4-pro → deepseek-chat → gemini-2.5-flash |
| REASONING | deepseek/deepseek-reasoner | $0.14 | $0.28  | deepseek-v4-pro → grok-4.3 → qwen3.7-plus → gemini-3.5-flash → o4-mini → o3                                                                                                                                        |

---

## ECO (Absolute Cheapest)

Use `blockrun/eco` for maximum cost savings. The first stop is the free tier, so simple requests can cost $0.00.

| Tier      | Primary Model               | Input | Output | Fallback chain (in order)                                                                                                |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SIMPLE    | free/nemotron-3.5-lightning | $0.00 | $0.00  | nemotron-3-nano-30b (free) → gemini-2.5-flash-lite → glm-5.3-flash → gpt-5.6-luna → gpt-5.4-nano → gemini-3.1-flash-lite |
| MEDIUM    | zai/glm-5.3-flash           | $0.15 | $0.50  | deepseek-chat → gemini-3.1-flash-lite → gpt-5.6-luna → gpt-5.4-nano → gemini-2.5-flash-lite → gemini-2.5-flash           |
| COMPLEX   | zai/glm-5.3-flash           | $0.15 | $0.50  | deepseek-chat → minimax-m3 → deepseek-v4-pro → gemini-3.1-flash-lite → gemini-2.5-flash                                  |
| REASONING | deepseek/deepseek-reasoner  | $0.14 | $0.28  | deepseek-v4-pro → qwen3.7-plus → minimax-m3 → glm-5.3-flash                                                              |

The two free rungs at the head of ECO SIMPLE follow NVIDIA's free hosting, which retires models without notice (deepseek-v4-flash 410'd 2026-08-12, seed-oss-36b 2026-08-03, gpt-oss-120b hung 2026-08-16, and on 2026-08-30 NVIDIA retired FOUR of the five visible free models at once). Each retirement retargets the free rungs to the current free tier; the paid rungs never move. `src/router/free-model-liveness.test.ts` fails the build if a chain names a free model the picker no longer lists.

---

## PREMIUM (Best Quality)

Use `blockrun/premium` for maximum quality. Codex for complex coding, Gemini 3.5 Flash for simple work, Sonnet 5 for reasoning/instructions, Fable/Opus for architecture, audits and PM-grade work.

| Tier      | Primary Model             | Input  | Output | Fallback chain (in order)                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SIMPLE    | google/gemini-3.5-flash   | $1.50  | $9.00  | gemini-3.6-flash → claude-haiku-4.5 → glm-5.3 → gemini-2.5-flash → gemini-3.5-flash-lite → deepseek-chat                                                                                                                                     |
| MEDIUM    | openai/gpt-5.3-codex      | $1.75  | $14.00 | claude-sonnet-5 → kimi-k3 → glm-5.3 → gemini-3.6-flash → gemini-3.5-flash → gemini-2.5-pro → grok-4.5 → claude-sonnet-4.6 → gpt-5.6-terra                                                                                                    |
| COMPLEX   | anthropic/claude-fable-5  | $10.00 | $50.00 | claude-opus-5 → claude-opus-4.8 → claude-opus-4.7 → claude-sonnet-5 → claude-sonnet-4.6 → grok-4.5 → kimi-k3 → gpt-5.6-terra → gpt-5.5 → gpt-5.4 → gpt-5.3-codex → glm-5.3 → deepseek-v4-pro → deepseek-chat → nemotron-3.5-lightning (free) |
| REASONING | anthropic/claude-sonnet-5 | $3.00  | $15.00 | claude-sonnet-4.6 → claude-opus-5 → claude-opus-4.8 → claude-opus-4.7 → grok-4.5 → deepseek-v4-pro → grok-4.3 → o4-mini → o3                                                                                                                 |

The premium COMPLEX chain is deliberately de-Gemini'd: Google's "high demand" 503s correlate with Anthropic outages (everyone falls back to Google at the same time), so the chain prefers the in-family Opus hot swaps, then xAI, Moonshot, OpenAI and Z.AI — providers on independent infrastructure.

## AGENTIC (Multi-Step Tool Use)

Not a profile you pick — router-core switches to these tiers when the turn actually needs its attached tools (`inferToolRequirement`: `tool_choice: "none"` is authoritative, and host tool _descriptions_ alone do not trigger it). Primaries favour models that keep going instead of stopping to ask.

| Tier      | Primary Model             | Input | Output | Fallback chain (in order)                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| MEDIUM    | openai/gpt-5-mini         | $0.25 | $2.00  | gemini-3.5-flash → glm-5.3-flash → gpt-5.6-terra → gpt-4o-mini → claude-haiku-4.5 → deepseek-chat → kimi-k3                                                                                                                |

Set `routing.overrides.agenticMode: false` to disable the agentic tier set, or `true` to force it.

## FREE (`/model free`)

`free` is an alias, not a routed profile: it pins the free-tier default, currently **`free/nemotron-3.5-lightning`** — the same model that opens ECO SIMPLE. If that model is excluded (`/exclude add lightning`) or the budget cap forces a free fallback, the proxy walks the free cascade in this order: nemotron-3.5-lightning → nemotron-3-nano-30b → laguna-xs-2.1 → north-mini-code → nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning → nemotron-3-ultra-550b → llama-3.2-11b-vision. All seven are $0.00 and need no USDC, and all seven are treated as **text-only** — see the vision note below.

The order is not arbitrary. The head is whatever the gateway itself redirects the previous head to, so the proxy and the gateway never name different models. After it comes the fastest rung, then the two sub-second coders — adjacent on purpose, because they sit on _different_ capacity pools (our own NVIDIA key vs OpenRouter's $0 pool), so one pool's outage cannot take both. The vision model sits mid-chain, and the two slowest rungs go last. The tier stopped being NVIDIA-only on 2026-08-30: two of the seven come from Cohere and Poolside.

Pin any of them directly with `/model lightning`, `/model nano-30b`, `/model laguna`, `/model north-mini`, `/model nemotron-omni`, `/model ultra-550b` or `/model llama-vision`.

**No free model carries the `vision` flag,** even the two the upstream catalogs advertise as vision-capable. A 64×64 solid-colour probe on 2026-08-31 got the right answer 1 time in 4 from `nemotron-3-nano-omni` on Base, and "white" for red on Solana — where the response's own `model` field showed a silent fallback to a text model. `llama-3.2-11b-vision`, despite the name, said "I'm unable to see the image" on 3 of 3 while a plain-text control passed. Every one of those is an HTTP 200, so the caller gets a confident wrong answer with nothing to branch on. Since `vision` is what `filterByVision()` uses to _aim_ image turns at a model, flagging them would route real traffic into that. Requests carrying an `image_url` go to a paid vision model.

## Profile weights

How survivors are ranked, per profile (router-core `DEFAULT_ROUTING_CONFIG.portfolio`):

| Component     | AUTO |  ECO | PREMIUM | Role                                                    |
| ------------- | ---: | ---: | ------: | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task quality  | 0.47 | 0.36 |    0.58 | Prefer models validated for the detected task shape     |
| Capability    | 0.20 | 0.20 |    0.20 | Preserve the request contract after hard filtering      |
| Cost          | 0.18 | 0.28 |    0.08 | Reward efficient qualified candidates                   |
| Speed         | 0.07 | 0.10 |    0.06 | Ordinary interactive latency                            |
| Reliability   | 0.03 | 0.04 |    0.06 | Prefer stable candidates                                |
| Curated order | 0.05 | 0.02 |    0.02 | A small, explainable prior toward the chain order above |

High-stakes turns add `+0.08` quality / `+0.05` reliability; latency-sensitive turns add `+0.08` speed. An `affinityFloorGap` (auto 0.10, eco 0.22, premium 0.05) stops a candidate materially below the best task affinity from winning on price alone — which is why ECO can still climb to a paid model for work the free tier would botch.

## ECO vs AUTO Savings

Combined input + output rate per 1M tokens, primaries only:

| Tier      | ECO   | AUTO   | Savings  |
| --------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| SIMPLE    | FREE  | $2.80  | **100%** |
| MEDIUM    | $1.75 | $4.95  | **65%**  |
| COMPLEX   | $1.75 | $14.00 | **88%**  |
| REASONING | $0.70 | $0.70  | 0%       |

The published savings claim (**84%** on `auto`, **98%** on `eco`, against pinning Claude Opus 5) is blended across a stated workload mix and priced on the live catalog — see [`savings-mix.json`](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/blockrun/blob/main/src/brand/savings-mix.json). Per-tier numbers above are illustrative; the blended figure is the one to quote.

---

## How Tiers Work

- **SIMPLE**: factual lookups, greetings, translations, short responses
- **MEDIUM**: summaries, explanations, data extraction, moderate code
- **COMPLEX**: large context, multi-step analysis, substantial code generation
- **REASONING**: proofs, formal logic, multi-step math, chain-of-thought

Two overrides apply on top of the scorer: conversations above 100K tokens are forced to COMPLEX, and structured-output requests (JSON/YAML) are lifted to at least MEDIUM. Ambiguous requests (confidence < 0.7) default to MEDIUM.

## Rollback and shadow mode

- `routing.strategy: "rules"` reverts to the V2 tier selector (primary-first, no portfolio ranking) without a code change.
- `routing.shadow: { strategy: "rules", sampleRate: 0.1 }` recomputes a comparison decision locally on a sample of requests and reports it on `x-clawrouter-*` debug headers. It never issues a second paid completion and never persists prompt content.

See [configuration.md](./configuration.md#routing-configuration) for the YAML.
