/**
 * When two wallets disagree, say which one is paying (#315).
 *
 * `resolveExistingWalletKey` prefers BlockRun Core over ClawRouter's legacy
 * `wallet.key`, and `migrateLegacyWalletToCore` copies legacy into Core only
 * when Core is ABSENT — so in the common case both hold the same key and the
 * precedence is invisible. It becomes visible when Core was written
 * independently by another BlockRun product while ClawRouter already had its own
 * funded wallet: payment moves on upgrade, requests fail on an empty balance,
 * and the funded wallet sits idle.
 *
 * The precedence is deliberate and stays — preferring legacy would make Desktop
 * display and fund one address while the proxy spends from another, and refusing
 * outright would turn a working install into a hard failure. What these pin is
 * that the switch is no longer silent, and that the ordinary same-key install
 * stays quiet.
