/**
 * Regression test for the chat path (`/v1/chat/completions`) leaving its paid
 * upstream running after the client disconnects — the same shape as #251, which
 * was fixed for the media handlers. `proxyRequest` wired its disconnect abort to
 * `req.on("close")`, but on Node (verified on v24.15.0) an IncomingMessage emits
 * `"close"` when the request-body readable finishes, not when the client hangs
 * up. The body is fully drained near the top of `proxyRequest`, so `"close"` has
 * already fired by the time the listener is attached far below — the handler
 * never ran and the upstream fetch was orphaned. The abort now hangs off
 * `res.on("close")` (guarded by `!res.writableEnded`), mirroring every media
 * handler. This pins the upstream observing the abort after the client destroys
 * its request.
