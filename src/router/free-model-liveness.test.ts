/**
 * Guard: the router must never fall back to a free model that is dead upstream.
 *
 * This exists because of a concrete regression. `free/seed-oss-36b` went HTTP 410
 * EOL at NVIDIA on 2026-08-03. ClawRouter dropped it from the picker and the
 * FREE_MODELS cascade in v0.12.241, but the routing tiers now live in the
 * separately-versioned @blockrun/router-core, so a stale build put the dead model
 * back into three fallback chains with every product-side surface already correct.
 *
 * That matters beyond a wasted hop: BlockRun server-redirects retired free ids, so
 * routing to one SILENTLY DEFEATS `/exclude` — the caller excludes a model, the
 * router hands it the request anyway, and the gateway answers from the redirect
 * target. The 713 tests in this repo did not catch it, because router selection
 * coverage moved out of the repo along with the code.
 *
 * The allowed set is DERIVED, not hard-coded: it follows `src/top-models.json`, so
 * a future free-tier resync updates this guard for free. Adding a model here by
 * hand is the wrong fix — update the picker instead.

 * a chain id is live if the picker carries the same model under either prefix.
 *
 * The gpt-oss-120b/20b allowlist that used to sit here is gone: those ids were
 * "hidden but served" until they weren't — the gateway answers 400 Unknown
